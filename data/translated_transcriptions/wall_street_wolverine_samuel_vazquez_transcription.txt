From moment 00:00:00 to 00:00:00 Interviewer says: "Are the police in general excessively politicized?"

From the moment 00:00:02.660000 to 00:02:48.500000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Our police model is absolutely absorbed by the political perspective...A large part or almost all of what is done is to protect the president's speech from shift...That is precisely why police leaders take them by free appointment...Free appointment is usually, in all large organizations, the beginning of mediocrity, if not, of corruption...Who is the general director of the Civil Guard of Spain? Look for his resume... Are they experienced police officers? Do they have studies in criminology? Do they have any type of work, studies carried out on police or criminal science? He has been working for the entire life party...To return it to the street you have to use a lot of force...And that in politics has a cost...You can see thousands of protesters throwing paving stones at you, throwing anything at you, spitting on you, insulting you...No cost politician...Now, like a police officer gets out of line and hits two too many punches, because he has been enduring insults for three hours, because the guy in front of him has messed with his wife and family, and they are trying to get him penguin saying, no, no, don't charge, Hold on, Hold on, Hold on. That opens all the news. Violence, when applied by the State, has a very high cost in politics. Until a politician appears willing to assume that cost, we will continue to lose neighborhoods, we will continue to conquer cities...Of the last ten arrested in Catalonia for terrorism, I think seven or eight lived in occupied buildings...It is the ideal scenario... What criminal, what criminal, what terrorist does not want to reach a country where all of Christ enters through the borders, thousands of people a year, and you can go to a city where without registering yourself, without going to any office, without giving Your Dni, your Nie, without Nothing, you can live with the water and electricity that the city hall provides you... The thing is that for this guy, to integrate him, you don't need to do anything more than give him a job... But for someone who comes from sub-Saharan Africa or one who comes from North Africa, it's not like that... It's not a question of racism and xenophobia... It's just that it comes from a world and a civilization that has nothing to do with yours ...You are driving in such a quiet car, with your Coca-Cola in the east, looking out the window, and Fénix 14, Fénix 14, 14 Venezuela Street, sexual assault in progress, please, urgent... Since That same moment, your heart rate goes up, your adrenaline goes up... Then you turn on the priority ones, the noise of the siren, the lights, they get louder and louder... And you want to get there. And the next curve almost killed you...And He says, no, I am against violence, I am a peaceful person...He says, let's see, My daughter...What capacities do you have for Violence? You have weapons ? Use of weapons? Have you learned to handle them? Armed confrontations? Have you used violence many times in your life? Have you belonged to a security force or body? Do you have combat experience? Do you do combat sports? nothing, absolutely nothing, then you are not Pacifica. You can't, you are harmless. "Very good family and welcome."

From the moment 00:02:55.120000 to 00:03:01.200000 Interviewer says: "one more day to Wall Street Wolverine. I think today we have a guest who is going to bring us. Enough to talk about, Samuel Vázquez. How are you? "Very good, nice to be with you."

From the moment 00:03:03.380000 to 00:03:03.380000 Samuel Vázquez says: "a real pleasure. Show up for who"

From the moment 00:03:05.160000 to 00:03:11.340000 Interviewer says: "I don't know you, although I think you are someone who, in recent years, has given us a lot to talk about, especially because of the issue of Insecurity that we are suffering in Spain increasingly?"

From the moment 00:03:14.900000 to 00:04:35.040000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Broadly speaking, I am Samuel Vázquez, president of A Police for the 21st Century, which is today the largest prescribing association of police science in there is in Spain...I have a degree in Criminology from the University of Salamanca and in the last 20 years I have been a member of the operational response groups of the National Police in the south of Madrid...I am also a writer and columnist. That's more or less it... And my desire was to prepare myself, train myself to change that. From the beginning. I started writing a novel, Poetic Justice, which was the first way or form of rebelling... but it didn't reach me, it didn't reach me. I arrived. And I wanted to change things. And so to change things you have to have training. You have to have experience, I gained that over the Years in the Field. But you have to have academic training, you have to know. You have to do comparative studies. with what has happened in Sweden, in France, you have to read, you have to... and then obviously, if you are going to choose a career when you are already an Adult, as was my case, when you already have a Profession, as was my case. Case, for my Profession, criminology was evidently the Career to choose. When we talk about a police model, what do you specifically mean by a model?

From the moment 00:04:38.720000 to 00:04:38.720000 Interviewer says: "police? A police model is the way in which they are taken, within the world of security,"

From the moment 00:04:44.460000 to 00:06:00.200000 Samuel Vázquez says: "the security forces and bodies take the strategies and guidelines are created and directions are formed. That is what ends up affecting the citizens, the bottom part. What is done? How is it done? Why is it done? What is not done? And why is it not done? So, our police model is absolutely absorbed by the political perspective. Great part or almost everything that is done is to protect the speech of the president in power. That is precisely why police leaders, the top of the hierarchical pyramid, are chosen by free designation. The free designation is usually, in all large organizations, the principle of mediocrity, if not, of corruption. So, the way in which we take the . The way in which we decide on the strategies has to change, it has to be professionalized. Because our model served for decades in medium-low criminal stages, 90, beginning of this century, but the criminal reality has changed. In Europe it changed before it did here and now a new criminal reality is being imposed here... We do not have a police model prepared for this new criminal reality. Sorry, either we professionalize it too much, or we reverse it from top to bottom. Or not, we have it, we have a police model from the 80s. So can we say that the police in general are excessively politicized?

From the moment 00:06:04.980000 to 00:06:04.980000 Interviewer says: "Or intervened too much by politics?"

From the moment 00:06:11.160000 to 00:06:33.080000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Look at what communication is in the police. Here I am sitting with six disciplinary files. None for doing my job. I have been in the groups for 19 years response operations. This implies 6,000,7,000 services responded to 091 or 112. I have never ever been reported. They have never opened a file for an abuse of authority, for making more of an intervention...I have all my files to give an opinion For giving an opinion as the president of a civil association. That is to say, over which the disciplinary regime should not have any supervisory power. And yet they use it knowing that when we get to administrative litigation they are going to lose it. They don't care. "They neither pay the money for the litigation nor are they going to end up dismissing anyone. The General Directorate of the Police loses hundreds of disputes a year and they do not dismiss anyone. It is the wear and tear they use to try to silence you."

From the moment 00:07:09.400000 to 00:07:15.300000 Interviewer says: "And how do you hope to put an end to this politicization? If it is the politicians, in a certain way, who remove and replace those leaders... Of course, there "There is the problem. It is very, very difficult."

From the moment 00:07:18.600000 to 00:08:14.780000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Very, very difficult because there are no magic solutions or magic tricks...In New York, when the New York at war is reversed, which was the New York in the 80s, and Bratton reversed it in 1994, when Giuliani chose him to be chief of police, and he surrounded himself with operational police, Jack Mappel, Luía Nemone, John Timoni... he only It changes. If we are lucky enough to have a strong man appear, a politician. willing to assume the Cost. Because changing the police model has a Cost. To reverse it we must apply many doses of force, which I call it. Because it is protected. by law, Violence. Those who live enchanted in chaos, in a world of chaos, will call it what they take political advantage of chaos, so that has a cost. But during its first year it had criticism. I think that? Who was missing for criticizing Bukele? The UN, the Inpis, all the organizations. It has a cost. You will know how to withstand that blow, you will know how to withstand that challenge. We always give the example of France and Saint-denis. Saint-denis is pacified for six months. Now, you will have to enter with great violence and you will have to stay. And that implies that people may die in those six months."

From the moment 00:08:38.560000 to 00:08:40.220000 Interviewer says: "By lowering it, what do you mean by violence? That the police are going to have to enter in a way that we are not used to seeing. In the West to which we are accustomed. The French are accustomed to the Paris of Amnabur, the Paris of Bohemia. Look at the photos of Paris from the early 80s, the 70s and you will see what comes out. But that Paris no longer exists. That Paris no longer exists."

From the moment 00:09:02.480000 to 00:10:19.400000 Samuel Vázquez says: "and today's police cannot.behave like the police of the 70s and 80s.in Spain in the 80s.when a national police or a Tricorn appeared in a fight, 9 out of 10 times the Fight broke up. just with the presence, they ran away. because there was authority. and respect for authority, today you go to a fight in the middle of Madrid. A single car cannot go, it has to wait on the corner. Until two or three more cars are nearby. When they enter, they throw you at Doquines. They spit on you, they record you with their cell phone, then they upload it to the networks and You have to use and call reinforcements to 10.15 police officers to end the fight. The concept of authority has disappeared...So, to return him to the street you have to use a lot of force. And does that have a cost in politics? You You can see thousands of protesters throwing paving stones at you, throwing anything at you, spitting at you, insulting you, at no political cost. Now, like a police officer gets out of line and hits two too many rubber hits, because he has been enduring insults for three hours, because he The guy in front of him has messed with his wife and his family and they are on his ear saying no, no, don't carry on, hold on, hold on, hold on... And at a given moment we are human beings, a police officer He escapes the line and hits two or three shots too many. That opens all the news...All the news...Violence, when applied by the State, has a very high cost in politics...Until a politician appears willing to assume that cost, we will continue to lose. neighborhoods, we will continue to conquer cities."

From the moment 00:10:23.680000 to 00:10:25.700000 Interviewer says: "within the police in general? More in the lower part? Not that"

From the moment 00:10:27.780000 to 00:11:31.480000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Conceive, I have it in mind. I live it and I am absolutely sure that it is like that because that is how it is transmitted to me. It doesn't matter which city I go to Almost all the police know me. They stop, they get out of the car. Hey, you're right in everything you say, well I'm going to tell you. One thing, more and more police officers in Private. In public, they approach you. .or you get messages, they get your phone somehow and they tell you that you are on the right path. you find out what is happening in Malmo or in Marseille, according to, well you have done a live interview the other day with the.this terrorist from Brussels who.was ahead of the police and the.well, this is over, it's Surreal.What's happening in Brussels is Unacceptable.it's incomprehensible.and it's surreal, it's actually Surreal.a question that I think will have a lot of people"

From the moment 00:11:32.860000 to 00:11:37.440000 Interviewer says: "How can the Police take so long to act? to infer why"

From the moment 00:11:38.940000 to 00:12:58.100000 Samuel Vázquez says: "but neither do I, that is to say. I don't know the Belgian police in depth, but obviously this would have to have responsibilities at all levels. I want reassure people. This in Madrid is impossible. Impossible. Period. It is not debatable...How long would it take to neutralize a...? I don't know how he would have been beaten. I do know that it is unfeasible that before 5 minutes. That man did not have police behind him. Not viable in Madrid. A question that I believe many people also ask."

From instant 00:13:00.660000 to 00:13:00.660000 Interviewer says: "How does an M16 get into the hands of a terrorist?"

From the moment 00:13:06.480000 to 00:14:45.300000 Samuel Vázquez says: "when we are a drain, when the Wolves allow them to occupy territories, impose themselves, expand, it is relatively easy. Realize that we are surrounded by. ..Europe is still a bit of that ideal space to live in, that space of peace and tranquility, but we are surrounded by a world that is a very violent world and of wars, and from those wars many weapons come out and there are black markets and there are lines very simple penetration because our borders are very weak...Europe is economically the most powerful in the world, we have the most advanced systems in everything, we have the most advanced welfare state, but our borders are very permeable and are very poorly monitored. ..And that serves for human trafficking, it serves for arms trafficking, it serves for all types of black market. There is a scene in one of these Italian mafia series, Suburra, there is a scene in which there is a meeting at the highest level between a papal envoy, a politician and a member of the police, let's say, half bought or bought whole, in which they announce to the Pope's envoy... the mafia has already discovered that it is being trafficked human beings is the drug of the 21st century, that is, now they are going to get the money from here, all the money they got from drugs in the 20th century. They are going to get it from human trafficking... it is very very difficult, they enter, they enter and we are seeing attacks with Kalashnikov, attacks like the other day are weapons of war, and we will continue to see them, it is like that...And also with the issue of drug trafficking"

From the moment 00:14:47.360000 to 00:14:52.640000 Interviewer says: "If I'm not mistaken, I think we are at historic highs. Cocaine arrival. At least in Europe. Of course, when you generate a structure of route"

From the moment 00:14:54.760000 to 00:15:52.440000 Samuel Vázquez says: "That route is open for everything you . And today, before . We have a notion from the 80s. That the clans of the drugs. Well, in Spain, you will remember the Galician clans. They received drugs from the Colombian clans. Everything was very distributed, right? They were dedicated to other types of crimes, but now everything is very global. Now everyone uses them. structures and strategies of Others, because they come together. And the criminal groups, those that are large, powerful at a global level, can and can use drugs, and can use human trafficking, white slavery, and they can use Arms trafficking, all the same group. And they have Created a network and a route and it serves them for everything, because we live in a very global world, because Everything has become very close. A trip that was .unthinkable 40 or 50 years ago, today nothing is done, today absolutely nothing is done, so we are permeable, very permeable to evil, very permeable to everything that can favor our own self-destruction. I commented before about Sweden, what has happened. in"

From the moment 00:15:58.820000 to 00:16:03.360000 Interviewer says: "Sweden to go from being, I would say, the safest country in the world to one of the countries that has the most shootings per week, well, this has happened in Sweden well the same as it is"

From the moment 00:16:08.040000 to 00:16:13.120000 Samuel Vázquez says: "here we are in the hands of the worst at the worst moment in Sweden, this moment was 20 years ago, just like in France."

From the moment 00:16:15.080000 to 00:16:17.240000 Interviewer says: "Not many people know this. There are people who believe that Sweden is still a tremendously peaceful place."

From the moment 00:16:19.420000 to 00:17:31.080000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Yes, yes. It was, let's see, very recently... Sweden won before France... France still took a while a little more, but Sweden was 10 years. a little more... I don't remember the name of the Chief of Police of Stockholm now, but if you go to Twitter, sorry, to Youtube, and search for an interview with CNN Mexico. with the chief of police of Stockholm, Karin Gottlof, it's from 15 years ago, no more, no more. Mexico, you know it has a big violence problem...So they decide to call an expert...They say, well, Let's call someone...What is the safest country in the West? Sweden...Call the police chief of Stockholm...she is the typical bread here in Spain...A charo guy, as we would say. Exactly... And he says, what have you done to ensure that the Streets of Stockholm? He says, We have obviously Applied, our pulse has not trembled when applying the Gender Perspective in the Configuration. demands, we have gone to the schools.because these are social problems, not criminals.the police is the Minimum.intervention, the real problem is social aid,education.all the speech you are hearing here.the 2030 agenda.20 years before 2030.everything and In reality it was nothing like that, it was nothing, absolutely nothing. The signs were like this, Do it, Do it."

From the moment 00:17:31.080000 until 00:17:31.080000 Interviewer says: "the posters were like this, Do it, Do it"

From the moment 00:17:33.420000 to 00:18:39.160000 Samuel Vázquez says: "of course, the Processes of overflowing illegal immigration began to arrive that have nothing to do with immigration, immigration is an asset for a country .illegal immigration processes Overflowing.in space and time of People.coming from territories with which you share.nothing, neither culture, nor language, nor religion.nor the treatment and respect towards Women.nothing, They were overwhelmed in Sweden. Then they were overwhelmed in France, that impacted. And who they had in charge of Security. In Sweden, to Pam Esta. Of course, I like my world. And I study it and I investigate it. I say, I go Let's see who this Lady is. Because I say, she will be like me, she will have a curriculum. She was a Primary School teacher. They had made her Chief of Police. Why? Because she had the Party card. And she protected the Party's speech. .so now I tell the Spaniards: who is the general director of the police in Spain? who is the general director of the Civil Guard of Spain? conducted on police or criminal science? He is a party guy, a trusted man in the party. "He has been working for the Party all his life. Who is he going to protect?"

From the moment 00:18:43.900000 to 00:18:52.980000 Interviewer says: "I think it's going to give you a lot to think about. Because I think few people are aware. Of how politicized the police are. And the level of risks "What can lead to the citizen"

From the moment 00:18:55.720000 to 00:19:49.380000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Prioritize the political perspective over the professional one. If you are protecting a politician and not the people. It is leaving citizens at the feet of horses How long have we been on alert 4? Since 2014? So, at alert level 4, those who have training, there are thousands of police officers with excellent training, and those who have materials for a stop bleeding, for example, That every week a police officer saves someone by stopping a hemorrhage, you just have to go to the press. In Spain, right? It's because he has paid for it out of his pocket... How, how? That he has paid for it out of pocket. your pocket. You're going through Madrid now, right? You're going to see almost all the police in Madrid...I mean, they have to finance themselves."

From the moment 00:19:49.380000 to 00:19:50.160000 Interviewer says: "So, they have to be financed...Yes, yes, yes. Almost all the police officers that you see today in Madrid, if you look at them the back, you will see that they have a device like that, which has a red cross on it. That is, if tomorrow they hurt you with a knife, the first one who will arrive is a police officer. Because the police patrol, sectorizing the city. The Firefighters leave a base, ambulances leave a base, but the first one to arrive is the police. Those 5 or 10 minutes until the ambulance arrives are the difference between life and death."

From the moment 00:19:50.160000 to 00:20:46.640000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Yes, yes, yes. Almost all the police officers you see today in Madrid, if you look at their backs, you will see that they have a device So, it is with a red cross. That is, if tomorrow they hurt you with a knife, the first one who will arrive is a police officer. Because the police patrol by sectoring the city. The firefighters leave a base, the ambulances leave a base, but the first one to arrive is the police. Those 5 or 10 minutes until the ambulance arrives are the difference between life and death...If you are bleeding, that police officer is going to stop bleeding with that material. The course to make that stop bleeding cost him 400 euros and no one paid for it, he paid for it from his payroll. And the material to make that stop bleeding cost him 100,200 euros. And if he spends it he has to buy another one. And he buys it out of his own pocket. Where is the money? Where? Painting the benches purple and the traffic lights, putting on skirts? There is the money...money is not where it should be.to protect citizens, it is always there to.protect the political speech of the president in power and we have been like this for 40 years. So,having"

From the moment 00:20:48.860000 to 00:20:48.860000 Interviewer says: "taking all this into account, what do you do for a basic police officer?"

From the moment 00:20:52.600000 to 00:20:57.160000 Samuel Vázquez says: "the gun, the irons and the defense that they usually call truncheon. And the rest are extras that"

From instant 00:20:58.840000 to 00:20:58.840000 Interviewer says: "if he wants. Now, thank God, the policy"

From the moment 00:21:00.820000 to 00:23:16.720000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Vests has improved a lot in relation to. when I entered, okay? When I entered it was incredible. as soon as I arrived at the Police. depending on how you were. You Economically. Because there are people who join the police. And they have never worked in other things. So it is their first salary, like let's say. But it was unthinkable to go and spend 500 Euros. From your first salary on a vest. It was unthinkable because Nobody gave it to you, absolutely nobody. This changed. It's sad to say it, because it's sad to say it. But hey, it has to be said, that's it. It has to be said and that's it. This changed with the death of our partner in Galicia. In a moment Robbery. She was accompanied by a person, who had been ex-geo. They arrived there, left. The robbers from the Bank just at that moment. They opened fire. They left the companion badly injured. And the companion was murdered. In Galicia, that caused a certain commotion. OK? And there always has to be misfortune for there to be a change in the police. But why? Did you think about the Companion? They didn't think about the companion, they thought about the political cost. There would have been another death without a vest, they said. This can't happen again. It's going to cost us a lot of votes. See how things would be. And now I'm talking about a PP government, I'm not talking about Marlaskan, I'm talking about years ago. How would things be? How much hurry would they have to buy the vests so that there would not be another misfortune that could be attributed to them, to the General Directorate? How quickly would they have to buy all the same vests, having died, as a colleague had died? They didn't buy ergonomic vests for women because women have breasts, they need Ergonomic vests. They were in such a hurry and that rush is the rush that comes from what we have been talking about since this interview began, to protect the power structure...If they kill another one of us next week, it will have an important political cost... .Buy vests quickly and distribute them quickly...they see you have to sign, they see you have to sign...I mean, man, I'm on my day off...No, no, you have to sign...You have to sign is that from the moment you sign we have already given you a vest...If something happens to you, the administration has already complied...Everything is done with that perspective...Everything, absolutely all of that, we have to change that mentality... But at the budget level, is the security issue so tight? But you do spend money."

From the moment 00:23:18.320000 to 00:23:24.200000 Interviewer says: "It's what catches my attention that there is money, I don't know, for a wild cricket study and there isn't... it catches my attention a lot... Exactly There is money for everything except for what really…”

From the moment 00:23:27.700000 to 00:24:49.680000 Samuel Vázquez says: "The citizen needs the police in his neighborhood to be trained, have materials and have enough police to protect that piece of land...That is what What the citizen needs...He doesn't need parades, nor impact studies of this or that. He needs that. That's the first thing. When you have that guaranteed, come on, if we have money left over, we'll do what you want to do. If we There is plenty of money. But you don't have that guaranteed. There are cities in Spain with 150,000 inhabitants, medium-high crime levels, where there are Saturday nights where there are one or two police cars. Two police cars. That's outrageous. ...But then you say, of course, could it be that there are few police officers in Spain? We have one of the highest rates of police officers per inhabitant, more than Germany, more than England, more than that. How many police officers are in bureaucratic work? How many police officers are there to maintain a system and a model that is almost permanently generating work for itself? for himself. Well, that has to be changed. That has to be changed. Money should be spent on what really matters. And what matters, what the police should do, is protect the neighbors, the citizens. That is your fundamental job. And for that we must focus on the operational police. Not in the command of the office, not in the management police, not in the corridors of power, not in the Palace intrigues, which is where everything is decided here, in this model. No, no, no... No, in these people who protect investigative police on the front lines, from scientists, a Z, that is the base, that is the absolute priority, it should be the absolute priority."

From moment 00:25:00.640000 to 00:25:00.640000 Interviewer says: "How do you see the issue of gender quotas regarding the police?"

From the moment 00:25:35.900000 to 00:28:56.460000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Then the woman is incorporated and gains prominence in society, but with a firm step, with conquests that she never loses. Then the politician of turn, the completely illiterate, who has no resume of anything, but is given a ministry and 500 million to spend, and says, no, no, these conquests are thanks to me...No, no, they are thanks to me And since he cannot prove that they are thanks to her, he accelerates the process...So, those processes of accelerationism that are studied, for example, in the Criminal groups, in the ultra groups, in the sexts and all this, have a very negative impact on society...I always give the example of an athlete. You discover an athlete, you are a professional...But then the smart guy on duty appears, the one who knows nothing, but has power, and He says, no, no, no, no. This is going to be a gold medal, but we are going to make a law so that it is at 15 years old, not at 20... Five years earlier it will be a gold medal because the Conquests are won and conquests are made and we are tired of patriarchal deterioration and we have come not to give in and to conquer...what happens if you try to shorten that process by five years? Physical training begins to generate injuries. Injuries begin to generate processes of mental frustration. Mental Frustration processes affect technology and the rest of the preparation. You have exhausted the athlete. The athlete who was going to be gold, you have destroyed her. Quotas and the rest of gender policies are exactly that. It is trying to accelerate a process that is not in line with the speed at which society is moving. The . Society has already been advancing for decades. The role of women when the Franco regime ends has nothing to do with the role of women when the Franco regime begins. The role of women when the 21st century enters has nothing to do with the role of women when democracy begins. It is a natural process. We don't need Irene and Pan for that. It is a natural process. Irene and Pan vitiate that process. They try to speed it up...they don't deserve to be there, when in reality, if you let time pass, within 10-15 years, you would already have that 25%...Because I know the female training processes and what They have affected the police. When I joined the police, practically no women did combat sports, or did crossfit, or did elite sports. Today you see very young colleagues arriving with one or two careers, but they also do boxing, they do jiu-jitsu, they do CrossFit. It's a natural process... You're going to have it, you're going to get it, but they don't want to get it... They want to take the credit for getting it. They want to go down in history, Transcend, like Queen Elizabeth. But you look nothing like Queen Elizabeth. Of course, you are oceans away from showing us films of Queen Elizabeth, My daughter. No, no, it's just not."

From the moment 00:29:12.460000 to 00:29:14.780000 Interviewer says: "What would you say is the most useful martial art for a police officer? Well, now martial arts are beginning to be applied, let's say, police personal defense, which is call, which is what is applied to our work. But now I think that what is used most now is everything applied, I don't know if I pronounce it correctly, this thing about grappling, about grabbing, which is something very related to jiu-jitsu, which now I believe would be the martial art closest to what police work is."

From the moment 00:29:42.700000 to 00:29:44.560000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Jiu-jitsu would be right now...Yes, knocking down and..."

From the moment 00:29:44.560000 to 00:29:45.560000 Interviewer says: "Yes, knock down and... Exactly. And that, you go to a police academy today of any force and you talk about jiu-jitsu and they believe "It's a Japanese movie."

From the moment 00:29:45.560000 to 00:30:23.780000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Exactly. And that, you go to a police academy today of any force and you talk about jiu-jitsu and they think it's a Japanese movie. ...We continue the same as in the 80s, both in training and practically everything, right? We have to bring in professionals, even if they are from outside, nothing happens... We have to bring in real professionals and exhaust the students in Ávila during the year they are there, exhaust them in processes like this jiu-jitsu so that later we do not see some interventions, which unfortunately we have had to see in this time ago, right? Where people begin to lose confidence in the police. ...Because those interventions have not gone well...I have not blamed the police officers...I have blamed the Officer training processes, which are insufficient."

From the moment 00:30:25.720000 to 00:30:37.300000 Interviewer says: "We were talking before about Bukele...He has been, let's say that I believe, one of the Presidents who has gained the most fame in the last year... Do you really think that everything he has achieved could be achieved in another way? Was there another way?"

From the moment 00:30:40.600000 to 00:32:13.980000 Samuel Vázquez says: "There was no other way...you can no longer protect the rights of Everyone. I understand that in a civilized world we would want a detainee to have all Rights. But there are scenarios of criminal degradation. Where you can only get out if you protect either the rights of the good or the rights of the Bad. But you don't get out by protecting the rights of Everyone. So the politician has to choose. the rights of Whom you want to protect. El Salvador was a scene of criminal Degradation of this type. a place where you couldn't go out on the street. where your daughter went out on the street and on the next corner, a gang member, yes She liked it, she said, you at six in my house. And if at Six that daughter was not at home to offer herself sexually, she would end up with her Face marked by a knife and probably her Brother with a beating behind a house...In that scenario of degradation, from there it does not turn any other way than with a policy of zero tolerance, to appeal again to Bratton and Giuliani in 1994. in New York, with a policy of Tolerance.zero. I wish that I would like more than to say no, that everyone's human rights can be respected. But it's a lie. There are no ideal scenarios. As a police officer I learned very early, responding to 112 and 091 notices, I learned very early that in life's difficult problems there are no good solutions. There are bad ones and less bad ones. And you have to choose. And that is the job of the politician. Either the bad one or the less bad one...The politician who sells you the good one, we are going to get out of here with education, social policies, respect for human rights. If you allow that politician to govern in El Salvador and you return to El Salvador in 20 years, he would be the same as he was 20 years ago. Exactly the same . And in those 20 years, how many people have died? How many young people? How many girls have been raped? We can't wait for your policies. We can not . This must be reversed now. Scenarios like El Salvador need vessels. There is no other."

From the moment 00:32:55.480000 to 00:32:55.480000 Interviewer says: "Sure, that's very confrontational"

From the moment 00:32:57.480000 to 00:35:42.940000 Samuel Vázquez says: "because I am very fond of American models. Because many people tell me. But why do you defend North American security models. With the crime that There is there? Yes, there is much more than here. I defend certain things that have been done in the United States. That are now being stopped being done. And that is why it is returning again. To increase violent crime rates. But that during the first era of the 90s. they were made, they began in New York. when Giuliani called William Bratton. and Bratton's plan was copied. then by all the big cities, in fact. Bratton's great tool, which is the CompStat. The Computer Statistics, It begins. in New York, but today all the major American police departments already have it. And what I tell the Citizens. This is very simple, Look, New York was a Zone of war, you can watch the movies from New York. of the 80s, it was a war zone, in New York there was one, no sirens sounded, but there was a kind of. after 11 they didn't let go down to the young people, right? A kind of curfew, right? There were 3,000 homicides. This is outrageous...So, after the arrival of Giuliani, Bratton, Mappel, Anemone, a zero tolerance plan was created...In five years, homicides and sexual assaults decreased by 80% ...80%. It's outrageous... It's the most successful police and criminal science plan in the West in the last 50 years. It's outrageous...I want that. That is to say, the United States came from here in terms of violence and we came from here... They were very bad, we were very good. But Bratton has pushed here and we, Sweden, Paris, Malmo, are going here... We are not starting from the same place, gentleman. The thing is that you knew the North American cities from 30 or 40 years ago...It's just that we didn't start from the same place. They have been there for a decade, I repeat, they are failing again. For one or two decades they did what had to be done to reverse crime and we are doing nothing and we are sinking. And European cities are increasingly looking more like the North American cities of the 1980s. Should we copy everything from the Americans? No, it does many things wrong...But the things that have worked there. Can we copy them? Man, of course we can copy them. And one of the things why. Bratton managed to take out New York. From the criminal dunghill. What New York had become. It is because of absolute prioritization. From the professional perspective on politics. See if that's the case. That Bratton gets fired in his third year. Giuliani throws him out. Thank God . Bratton left, but his strategy. "His plan survived with the commands he had chosen for him... And that allowed New York to become the safest capital among large American cities in 10 years."

From the moment 00:35:45.400000 to 00:35:45.400000 Interviewer says: "Do you think that the possession of weapons influences all this?"

From the moment 00:35:54.140000 to 00:37:55.220000 Samuel Vázquez says: "it is nothing like the debate in Spain...We are Curro Jiménez, they are not...We are razor-sharp...Yes, Yes, just as Hispanic-Americans are machete-savvy, they don't... They have a country built on the Go West, on the permanent conquest of territory towards the West, with a Winchester on the horse and a Colt on the waist. That's it. Their mentality is their history. The use, handling, and knowledge of weapons is very widespread...Very widespread. And with so many shootings. Would I be in favor of giving a father a weapon? Of seeing yourself involved in an intervention. In which your life or that of your family is in danger with a weapon. In the United States they were very high. In a Western country, very high. And arriving at that stage. To a bad man with a gun. Who can stop him? A good man with a gun. Yes. Now, well, do I ask for that same policy for Toledo, for Burgos? No, sorry, no. No, because Spain is not the United States. The possibility here of seeing yourself faced with an armed action with a gang is very, very low compared to the United States...So, the possibility of spreading the use of weapons among the population, with armed incidents being so low, would have a effect, I believe, negative... Our criminal idiosyncrasy is our criminal idiosyncrasy. It is true that it is changing. In Paris it has changed absolutely, in Stockholm it has changed absolutely and if we do nothing in Spain it will also change... but at the moment we cannot compare the use of weapons in a country like Spain to that of the United States. "Not because of mentality, not because of history, not because of criminal idiosyncrasy, because of nothing, absolutely nothing. And for example, the case of Switzerland?"

From the moment 00:37:59.720000 to 00:38:01.320000 Interviewer says: "problems on a social level with it. Look, me"

From the moment 00:38:01.320000 to 00:39:05.660000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Look, I. I don't use Switzerland as a parameter at all. There are certain countries, but not even economically. Nor, which also sets a lot of examples There are certain countries that have a certain success in certain things. Why? They are very small, very controlled territories, with a very particular idiosyncrasy, in which certain experiments can be successful. Compare those countries with a country of forty-odd million of inhabitants, gateway to two large continents, which is a stone's throw from a continent where hundreds of millions of people intend to enter...you cannot buy it.and the legalization of.weapons licenses in Switzerland.are of no use. as a parameter to analyze Spain. They do not serve, they do not serve, in the same way as when someone talks to me, I am not an economist, I do not pretend to talk about things that I do not know, nor do I get into fields that I do not know, I am not a Authoritative voice there. But well, I have certain friends. And when someone talks to me about Switzerland, no, it's just that I. Just like the things that work in Switzerland, they don't work, of course. They don't work in Spain. So the weapons are exactly the same."

From the moment 00:39:07.740000 to 00:39:11.040000 Interviewer says: "Culturally you said that there are certain weapons that are characteristic of some countries...Are there beginning to be weapons, for example, of the style that there are in Latin America and in Spain ?"

From the moment 00:39:19.380000 to 00:42:52.840000 Samuel Vázquez says: "The positive ones, the food, the music, which my daughter listens to, the clothes, but the negative ones too... Crime also marks everyone. social uses...That's why I always say that the exponential increases in violence have nothing to do with race...Nor does it have anything to do with nationality...Nationality is a role today...And in Spain, as it is delivered, a role that is worthless... This guy who eliminates us, as I always give as an example of the World Cup, But he plays with Morocco... His origin and his culture are there... .Parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents... It's normal... So, it has nothing to do with race, even if they call me racist... It has nothing to do with nationality, even though they call me xenophobic permanently when I go these politicians to the assemblies. It has to do with the origin of culture and this marks all social uses. And within the origin of culture is the use of certain materials for work and for violence as well...The machete is a very widespread instrument in certain Latin American countries for work. In many houses in Latin America, just like in many in Texas, there is a firearm, there is a machete... So, this must be understood. And in controlled, controlled immigration processes, you can exercise a certain authority over what comes and what is established. In processes of overflowing illegal immigration, what they do is occupy neighborhoods that end up imposing their worlds on our worlds. We have allowed that...And then the social dynamics that we have do not need to be accepted, because in that neighborhood there are no such social dynamics. As they are the majority, they have implemented their own social dynamics, they no longer need to accept ours... When they become strong, when they become more and more numerous, wolves always appear. Criminal gangs, organized groups, Saria, radical Islam. And those wolves say, in that field we are the majority...if we use force and violence.we can prevail.because we have to know and we have to understand.and we have to say it no matter how much they insult you.that these people.now that France suffered 20 years ago.and Sweden.they come from Failed States.that's why they all flee to the west.you know many Americans.from the Florida peninsula.no matter how bad things are going for them in life.they throw themselves into a sea of Sharks, risking death to get to Cuba, no, however, thousands of Cubans do risk dying in the bar to get to the United States. You know many of them, no matter how bad things go in life for an Andalusian who throws himself away. not to the sea to reach Africa, but Africans to reach Spain. Why? Because they come from failed states and seek the most free and prosperous civilization that has ever been known. Humanity, which is ours, it is better that we protect and defend it and in those failed States and everyone should know about it. Violence is a fundamental item to resolve conflicts and to climb the social pyramid. Spot . It is . We have Roman law, they do not. Therefore, when we allow them to replicate their worlds in our worlds, violence appears... say, I come here to tell you the truth, you don't like the truth, so do Like the Ostrich, when you see the lion, He puts his head in the ground, believing that he does not see the lion, believes that the lion does not see him, "

From the moment 00:42:56.800000 to 00:42:56.800000 Interviewer says: "do we do to better protect the borders?"

From the moment 00:43:00.440000 to 00:43:03.020000 Samuel Vázquez says: "We return to...If you were here to Rubén Pulido, who is the greatest expert in this right now..."

From the moment 00:43:05.820000 to 00:43:06.920000 Interviewer says: "Have you properly tracked the ships that enter and leave? Of course."

From the moment 00:43:09.040000 to 00:45:53.140000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Well, he always talks about how we can't sell our sovereignty to third states, right? Because it means putting the problem in the hands of someone else. The best thing is that he wants you badly. I see this from the perspective of the Police. From the perspective that I told you about before, that there are no good solutions, we can no longer provide a good solution to this, there isn't one, I hope. but there isn't, there is only bad and less bad. And now if the European Union worked as a bloc, really. If we had other types of elites, if we had more Melonis and less, what is this president's name? Wunderlein ,Wunderlein.more Melonis and less of.less of this, and we had a certain capacity for pressure, which we do, if we went hand in hand, we could influence the countries of North Africa, which also depend on us, right? What Australia did in the no Way policy... We must have three, four ports in North Africa with the status of Diplomatic headquarters in which both their ships, those of the country there and Our ships can enter. All people picked up at sea must be taken immediately, for the safety of those people, to the nearest port, not to the most European port, to the nearest port... And there they must be identified with all the guarantees, administratively managed with all the guarantees, and returned to their countries with all the guarantees of human rights, physical guarantees for their physical integrity and so on... What is the best we can do for them? Because for the Mediterranean to stop being a Cemetery, what we cannot do is continue. Inviting them to jump into the sea. Taking out posters from the other shore of Welcome Refugees. They are an invitation to Throw yourself. No, what we have is to prevent them from jumping into the sea. to the sea. This way we will avoid Muertos. So we have to ask the politician from Turno.es, what do you want? to do politics? which is what we are in Now. a strong European policy. with pressure on certain Countries. could put 3-4 ports in North Africa. once the African citizens. know that once they are intercepted at sea they will not reach Europe. They are going to return to a port in Africa. The same thing will happen that happened in Australia. When the No Way policy, the Australian Government paid. To New Guinea, it created a Port. In New Guinea, said all of you who enter .to be intercepted at Sea. You are not going to come to Australia, you are going to go to New Guinea. people said to risk my Life. to lose my Heritage. to get to New Guinea, which is the same as my Island. well no, They stopped jumping into the sea. It's that simple. I remember that with a level of adrenaline and then personal satisfaction."

From the moment 00:46:01.260000 to 00:46:04.760000 Interviewer says: "And doesn't seeing that generate immense anger in you at that moment? To say, how can this be possible?"

From the moment 00:46:07 until 00:46:07 Samuel Vázquez says: "A lot of anger. That's why I always..."

From instant 00:46:10.740000 to 00:46:10.740000 Interviewer says: "A lot, a lot, a lot."

From the moment 00:46:12.320000 to 00:48:19.080000 Samuel Vázquez says: "That's why I always say, Look, I understand everyone, I want everyone to be respected, but understanding the work of a Police .it's difficult. You have to put on the policeman's skin...From the moment the call rings, how the heat rises...From the moment you are in such a quiet car, with your Coca-Cola in the east , looking out the Window, and Fénix 14 sounds, Fénix 14, 14 Venezuela Street, sexual assault in progress, please, Urgent. from that very moment, the heart rate goes up. the Adrenaline goes up, then. you turn on the priority ones, it begins. noise of the siren, the lights. they get louder and louder, and you want to get there. and the next curve almost kills you. because you have taken it too open or too closed. because you want to get there, and you get there. and on top of that you see it, and you jump .from the car, of course, to ask that police officer not to give a hell of a lot more. I know that you have to ask him for it. That's very good, that seems very good to me, that you have to ask him for it. But if he comes to give you Please understand... about crime, I always say that we are no longer in the 90s. If that police officer, if someone has to give one more Host in your neighborhood, okay? Pray for your children. Because then almost everything will be lost...self-control. And that is my Best moment. And my worst moment was before yesterday. My worst moment was before Yesterday. Because well, those who follow me already know it. And therefore nothing happens. I have been appointed to special services in the National Police. by the Cortes as a Security Advisor in a Political Party that has placed its Trust in the project of a police force for the 21st century to reverse the crime that already exists. Then I had to go to the special congressional police station. The first day I handed in my weapon, ammunition, well, the rest of the material. I don't know if consciously or unconsciously, I don't know yet, I forgot my badge at home. My badge, the one that identifies me as a police officer. Obviously they told me, I'm sorry Samuel, you have to bring it the next day, you have to bring it now...You can't keep it as a souvenir."

From the moment 00:48:20.640000 to 00:48:20.640000 Interviewer says: "I can't keep it as a souvenir"

From the moment 00:48:21.880000 to 00:49:38.260000 Samuel Vázquez says: "And indeed before yesterday. I gave a colleague my plaque in Congress. And after that, it was not very well explained why. I I went out into one of these hallways. Lost in Congress, where I was alone. And I started crying. I don't know if it leaves me in a very good place. But I felt a kind of emptiness inside. A kind of emptiness inside. Because you feel. Not so much that you lose the Institution, because it is so politicized that sometimes it generates rejection, but you lose your colleagues, those who recently gave me a farewell dinner, those who I have been with them for years. these types of services, which are. many hours doing this type of services. and it is like. a drug, this profession, what I do. I don't know what it will be like in other areas of the Police. because I have never been in it. scientific police. I never imagine that it will also be very addictive. But what I do, which is riding in a police car and answering Services, from 091 to 112, is addictive. Believe me, it is addictive. So I had a bad time. and when I returned to my house, along the Paseo del Prado, heading towards the Toledo highway, a police Z passed me with the priority posts, sirens, acoustic lights, luminous lights, and I slammed the steering wheel and shouted, Let's go! "I want to be inside that car, that's my place, so the day before yesterday was my worst day at the police."

From the moment 00:49:42.560000 to 00:49:50.140000 Interviewer says: "you can inspire many new police officers who can achieve what you want to achieve and that also has a lot of merit in a certain part." "That worries me a lot because what you said could have an influence."

From the moment 00:49:57.760000 to 00:51:40.460000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Of course, now when I go to places, there is no longer a city in which I passed with my wife and my children where the police car Whether it's from the Civil Guard National Police Local Police. Let him come by and stop...And Samuel, you're Samuel, right? Yes, yes, I'm Samuel...Thank you for what you do, such and such...There is no more police building, Congress, when I arrived my first time in Congress, the police at the door, the police at the next street market, those in the hallways, exteriors, interiors, all... out of ten, okay? a lot of responsibility... .that what you do is.they feel reflected...and of course.that on the shoulders of a person like me.who am not superman,because sometimes.it generates a cost,but I see it,I feel it, I can feel what you say, that is, it is becoming more and more evident that the Message has penetrated. And until four days ago I would tell you that it has penetrated the police, but it has penetrated society, it is that I for older people. on the street that has nothing to do with the police. the butcher in the Ávila neighborhood where I'm going to walk with my wife stops me and I say to her, are you a partner? and he says, no, no, I'm a Butcher. But I've listened to you and you're completely right, you're completely right. More like you and some. They want to appoint you as Minister. Let them appoint you. as a minister And well, let's see, let's see because it is a lot of responsibility. We will try to live up to the responsibility, we will try to live up to it. Many young people will probably be watching you."

From the moment 00:51:42.700000 to 00:51:48.480000 Interviewer says: "you could also consider becoming a police officer at some point or a military officer or Geo, whatever you want to be. What message would you send them?"

From the moment 00:51:55.060000 to 00:53:05.780000 Samuel Vázquez says: "That during my professional career. They have put me in the car with me. Because there are days when your partner is missing. Well, it's called being peak. In the police and when you are on peak. Well, the normal thing is that the intern goes with the peak. I say I am not the one to give advice. I do not have the authority to give advice. I am not the one, if you want one. Which is the only one I'm going to give you, one. It's, always work. Always, always. for the people, No, it's nothing against the bosses, that some take it very badly, because there are many bosses, very good who work for the People, for the people, you will never make a mistake... But if you work for the bosses and you have a bad boss, you can make a lot of mistakes. You can do well in your professional career, you can go to a position. better, you can grow, you will realize. when you already overcome the barrier of 20-30 years. in the police, what happens to me when I interview. with many people who are already older, retired. you will realize that you have not deserved the Pena. It has not deserved the Pena. So in order not to make a mistake, and despite the fact that there are very good leaders in the Police, you always work for the People. You never work for the bosses."

From the moment 00:53:09.440000 to 00:53:13.140000 Interviewer says: "whatever you say, look, it's the time I've laughed the most as a Police Officer. but the time I've laughed the most is not mine, it's my officer"

From the moment 00:53:13.140000 to 00:54:57.580000 Samuel Vázquez says: "but the time I laughed the most was not mine, it was my officer's. Javi, well, now I'm an Inspector, which is one of the best police officers I have ever seen in my life. a type that serves as a police officer. that serves as an officer, that serves as a sub-inspector. that serves to create a group, to create group strategies. to resolve conflicts between the group. and almost everything He does well. And without a bad word, without raising his voice. With a lot of knowledge, a lot of Personal training. Of Involvement, of the fact that they are going to put me in this Position. I am going to study everything in this position. I am not going to pass by here like the one who passes by a line. No, no, no. It's in a police intervention, in an assault on a chalet, a robbery with force, come on, a classic robbery with force, back, chalet area, back , swimming pools, pool area, garden and pool... And they entered through the back, they were detected, they called, we entered through the chalet of a colleague who lived there, at 3 in the morning slamming the door, he opened it, Open, Open, they are in the back. In the swimming pools at the back, they went from one to the other jumping over the walls, the bad guys jumped, the police jumped, my partner jumped... in one of these he hooked himself to one of the Bad Guys. and they went to The Pool left, the bad guy left, my partner went to the pool, and he still came out like the Comical scenes, these ones from the jokes, he came out with the Mobile Phone on top of his hand so that Everything would get wet except the phone mobile.soaked, when things like that happen, the Profession is worth it, because you go to the police station. and while you Appear, because you have been arrested. the appearance is a Continuous. of laughing and laughing. and laughing and something to always remember. No ? Something to always remember. What would you say is the city right now?

From the moment 00:54:59.360000 to 00:55:03.660000 Interviewer says: "how easier can Spain fall within the crime issue? Barcelona, ​​Barcelona has already fallen"

From the moment 00:55:08.120000 until 00:55:13 Samuel Vázquez says: "Valencia, Zaragoza, and then Seville and Madrid, in that order. With similar crime profiles?"

From instant 00:55:16.280000 to 00:55:16.280000 Interviewer says: "or different? No, what"

From the moment 00:55:18.220000 to 00:55:58.140000 Samuel Vázquez says: "comes is everything, according to what has happened in Barcelona, ​​according to what has happened to the rest of the cities, it is practically the same... I'm sorry if you don't like to hear it, I'm sorry...We can't accept certain levels of excessive illegal immigration...We can't...Because immigration is an asset and because the one that hurts the most is the one who comes to work and who in the end ends up stigmatized without having a reason and we are harming him... And that one, when you talk to him, is the one who most... You know the number of people, with this of my famous appearance of the gangs Latinas in the Madrid Assembly and so on, the number of Hispanic-American people who approach me, the last one two days ago in the shopping center behind my house. It happens to me too, it's curious, but"

From the moment 00:56:00.080000 to 00:56:06.140000 Interviewer says: "It catches my attention, for example with Moroccans. It doesn't happen, that is, they take it as an Attack. But with Hispanic Americans, No. I can't understand that difference."

From the moment 00:56:08.760000 to 00:59:10.120000 Samuel Vázquez says: "well because it is cultural, because they are two totally different cultures, because they are two totally different civilizations, because they can be integrated very little by little and In a disintegrated manner, but it is impossible to integrate that type of civilization with ours. When they arrive in an overwhelming way, the great civilizations do not ally. It is a lie from the shoemaker, this shoemaker to your shoes. The great civilizations in history have never They have allied themselves, if perhaps for a short period of time and for interests. Then they have always competed, they have always confronted each other, they have always fought and one has made the other succumb. Always... And who usually wins? Civilization strong, the one that remains attached to its traditions, its culture, respecting all its rites. That is the one that usually wins. We shout, in Paris they said, now we are going to have secular education. Very good, and what is education? secular? No, we shout the school crucifix. And that is secular education? That is, Christianity is a moral foundation in our civilization...Europe, the West, is the search for truth and beauty of Greece, the rule of law of Rome, and Christian ethics and morality...This It's what we are, my son. It doesn't matter if you like it or not, I don't believe in God. That goes far beyond whether you believe or not believe in God...Besides, when you try to remove one morality, another comes to put another...And now there is no crucifix, right? What there are are thousands of girls who enter with their heads covered...And what there are are school cafeterias with personalized menus for a certain religion. So where is the secular school? 15 years ago I already told you that secular schools did not exist. What happens, since the current stage had not yet been reached, they called you everything. Human beings, human groups, the town, the tribe, the school, we are always going to cling to something. It has been this way since the beginning of time...The first monuments discovered are funerary monuments. Archaeological excavations give us funerary monuments. Monuments that have the intention of Transcending, of seeking the search for transcendence, of going to another place. We are always going to hold on to something. Always...So, if you have something to cling to that has constituted, in essence, the most prosperous and free civilization, as we said before, that humanity has known, why do you try to sweep that away? Do you think that wall is going to be empty? Another type of thing will come to cling to... When Goebbels orders crucifixes removed from schools in Germany, it is not so that the wall remains empty. It is so that the picture of the Führer remains. And above the Führer, no one. Chesterton said that if you don't believe in God you will end up believing in anything... If they empty you of all that, you will end up believing in any Pablo Iglesias, in any Ben de Motos, anyone will deceive you... And From there, everything sinks very quickly, everything deteriorates very quickly. And that is what we are in...Do you think it can be managed in the event that there is"

From the moment 00:59:13.060000 to 00:59:20.880000 Interviewer says: "a conflict in European countries due to a call from some Arab leader, let's say a civil war between the native population and the most Arab ?"

From the moment 00:59:25.340000 to 00:59:33.540000 Samuel Vázquez says: "in most of Europe that is Unfeasible. But it is true that we have two scenarios that must be analyzed, which are France and Sweden. that must be analyzed in great depth. Because I am seeing it right now."

From the moment 00:59:35.120000 to 00:59:39.020000 Interviewer says: "What about Palestine and seeing how everything is escalating, you are in a situation in which you say. What if tomorrow Iran says war on everyone?"

From the moment 00:59:50.640000 to 01:04:07.500000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Whether you want to see it or you don't want to see it, it doesn't matter exactly to me...Israel can have and have made hundreds of mistakes and it can be criticized, it just lacked ...Israel can be criticized, but Israel is a democracy in a world where what surrounds it is nothing like that democracy...The safest place in the Middle East for a woman who wants to be free is Israel ...You like it or you don't like it, accept it... At the University of Haifa, to speak of one of the Greats, thousands of students live together, Muslim students, Christian students, Jewish students, women who wear their heads covered and enter the classroom like that, they coexist without any problem... You just don't go there to kill Jews. It's not a requirement, let's say, very rigid, right? But the freedom that that woman has in that university she won't have even in her own land. So, we cannot judge Israel and put it on the same level as ever. It is because we cannot. It is because Israel protects its children and never uses them as a shield or parapet, it uses them...so if there are casualties, It is already seen that there are casualties, we cannot point to anyone other than Jamás, who is never the main person to blame for this, and we cannot point to an Israeli who lives surrounded by danger and tends to defend himself. to take defense to its maximum expression. Because only during the 20th century. three, four Wars. against them, yes, they have won them all. because they have a lot of military power, but they did not start them. So, we can discuss history, about. Judea, from . Canaan, for the Egyptians, for the Egyptians, that's fine, whatever you want. Well, there were Jews there before even the term Palestinian existed... But aside from that, Palestine has always, in history books, been more of a territory than a people. But hey, I'm not going to get into a historical discussion, I'm not an authority on the matter, but we can't compare Israel to ever... And now we have politicians in the government after the massacres we've seen. has come out to go against Israel...It doesn't make any sense...It doesn't make any sense...We are the admirer of Europe...But not even the most progressive, progressive in quotes, of course, because of progress these They don't know anything...But not even the progressives in the rest of Europe have the behavior that the partners of our President's Government have here...What could come of there? You cannot allow a neighborhood to be filled with a certain origin, what we call the Moro neighborhood, right? Commonly, because in the end they come from a failed world and end up installing that world in your world... And you go to a Moro neighborhood today. And only Muslims enter hair salons. Pork is not sold in butcher shops. And on the summer terraces. Never feel like a woman, only feel like men. So you have brought your world here. But if their world is good, why do they run away from it? It is absolutely a lie. To integrate you have to disaggregate. Concentration systems do not integrate anyone. Because the young man who is born in that neighborhood. In that world, he does not know the West. He doesn't know our... If everything that happens in that neighborhood is the same thing that happens in his parents' neighborhood of origin, how are we going to integrate it? I was born in 75, I'm not that old, and when I went to high school, in the early 90s, the fashion was to go to England, to spend a whole year, maybe you finished your degree, or before starting your degree Go to England because you have to learn English...In Spain no one spoke English. In Europe everyone spoke English. So, go to England and you will learn English. And when you come back and do your degree, you will have job opportunities everywhere...So, the Spaniard went to London. He spent a year washing dishes, which was the job they offered him, and he was surrounded by three guys who were washing dishes next to him, who were also Spanish...He went to the rented apartment and the one who slept with him was from Galicia. And the one next door was from Toledo. And he worked like this all year long. When he came back he didn't know any English. But who are you going to integrate with if you are always with your loved ones? To integrate you have to disaggregate. Sendenís is the opposite of integration. It is impossible to integrate into Western culture from Sendenís. Absolutely impossible."

From the moment 01:04:35.800000 to 01:04:35.800000 Interviewer says: "Very difficult. With very controlled processes, very rigid border control. The control that you must have over Latin American countries has nothing to do with that over African countries. But it's not judging anyone, it's just that we are different cultures. It's just that a guy who comes from Venezuela fleeing from Maduro's hunger, shares with me language, social customs, music, religion. It's just that to integrate this guy you don't need to do anything else "I have to give him a job."

From the moment 01:05:01.180000 to 01:06:52.940000 Samuel Vázquez says: "But to someone who comes from sub-Saharan Africa or to someone who comes from North Africa, it is not like that. It is not a question of racism and xenophobia It comes from a world and a civilization that has nothing to do with yours. So to integrate it you need much more time, many more strategies and many more things...I don't know if you are going to take a plane when you return. to your house, but if you take a plane, you are going to go through a paperwork, passport, and ID check. Your suitcase is going to go through an arch... and you too. If your suitcase is detected, a nail clipper is detected. They are going to remove it. But at the same time they are removing your nail clippers. You are a person with no criminal record. And with a permanent job. A ship is entering with 100 gentlemen. And we don't know where they come from. We don't know if they come. of waging war on another tribe and of having killed human beings. We do not know if they have sexually assaulted women in their territories. and they spread throughout the national territory. without any type of control. while they are taking away your cut nails. it doesn't make any sense. how can you call someone racist for reporting this? that doesn't make any sense, you can't even call your grandfather a racist when he feels afraid in a neighborhood because his neighbors have suddenly changed their profile, he doesn't feel afraid because of a race issue, he doesn't hate anyone, he feels fear of the unknown, he sees that his neighborhood is no longer the neighborhood where he was born and grew up, and every human being is afraid of the unknown, you cannot call that Mr. racist because say, hey, the neighborhood is not It's changing, you can't. How easy is it to call someone racist, right? "To do politics, how simple it is, to dehumanize the person in front of you because you have no way to counterargument him because you don't know, because you are illiterate. Besides, we have become very afraid of him, I think."

From the moment 01:06:54.860000 to 01:07:02.980000 Interviewer says: "to those qualifiers, in the sense that the moment they release the qualifier of racist, xenophobic, fascist, it is already like they crouch down .the head, like Uff, I don't want to be called that"

From the moment 01:07:07.120000 to 01:08:34.840000 Samuel Vázquez says: "I think that is changing Now. Now there is more Cultural battle. And there is a certain spectrum of society that has decided to say enough... Mining, industry, the steel industry that we had, I have to ask myself why... When I was young, I was the son of a miner, the net of a miner, the nephew of a miner, born in the mining basin, you know the mining basin, in revolutionary terms, very left-wing, I have grown up with those patterns. Then I read, I traveled, one knows the world and understands that it is possible that they are deceiving us. But I have always said about Asturias that Asturias will return to what it was back in the day. that Asturians lose their fear of being called fascists. There is an atrocious fear of being called...You may be defending the most absolute and most coherent truth in the world in your home, but how can that truth lead to you being called? facha en el chigre, in el chigre you don't say anything...See? Sabina, any person who has been left-wing all their life, at 90 years old, tells you a phrase outside the line of argument of power and they are out. ..It has ruined his entire career."

From the moment 01:08:34.840000 to 01:08:35.800000 Interviewer says: "He has destroyed his entire career...All of it, all of it. They liquidate you, eh? They liquidate you. An actor who says, I will never make a movie again "It is pointed out immediately. It is civil death."

From the moment 01:08:35.800000 to 01:09:39.260000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Everything, everything. They liquidate you, eh? They liquidate you. An actor who says, I will never make a film again, is immediately pointed out. It is death civil...Thank God we are not in the communist systems of the 20th century, they don't take you behind a wall and shoot you. But they kill you civilly...Jordan Peterson said that what we have to learn from Nazism is that You are the Nazi...Thousands, millions of Germans remained silent when they took out their neighbor for fear that if they criticized him, they would be the next to leave through the back door...People tend to adapt as a method of survival. ..Look at the Basque Country, look at the Basque Country, 80s... You put on your earring, that one that was worn in all the abertzales, that vacinilla pearl. Free way, go drink little ones. Now put on a little plaid shirt Go to Mass on Sunday. And call yourself Michelangelo, two shots in the back. What young man is going to want to be Michelangelo? Who? Young people want to flirt. Go out, go out as little ones, laugh. Adaptation as a method. Survival is a constant. In humanity, we must be very afraid. You have to have a lot of courage to face that equation. "Before we talked about the issue of human trafficking."

From the moment 01:09:41.660000 to 01:09:47.480000 Interviewer says: "I think it is a topic that must be addressed. Much more, I don't know if you have seen. All the controversy that this Movie has generated.de Sound Of Freedom. I haven't been able to see it"

From the moment 01:09:49.400000 until 01:09:49.400000 Samuel Vázquez says: "I still want to see it."

From moment 01:09:53.280000 to 01:09:53.280000 Interviewer says: "so much controversy talking about all this?"

From the moment 01:09:55.700000 to 01:11:54.880000 Samuel Vázquez says: "certain Taboos.due to the control that exists.from the political power of all types of communication.that may have a Derivative.that assumes truth for them cost...Because they want to control everything and that's it...Because they have given us an agenda...what you have to talk about. And now you have to Talk about climate change, gender perspective, and eco-sustainable vehicles ...Have you found out or haven't you found out? and if you start talking about something other than that, and you are a slave, you are not here to give your opinion... You are here to obey... So, Now there are a series of items that you have to Talk about. And you better soak them up... Because the world is going to end because of my damn diesel car... And that's it... And if You don't say that, they crucify you...Who is this to come here to oppose what we have said? I believe that we are beginning a stage against the revolutionary...I mean, there are more and more people who have grown tired ...He says, I don't feel like talking about climate change...I don't feel like talking about this...I feel like talking about this, look, about these People, about white slavery, about any Other. I feel like talking about this because I consider it an important problem. And your damn rain shower yesterday. Which apparently is because of me without Camil, well I don't accept it. And I don't feel like talking about it, that's it. And I think we are at the beginning of that Stage. I think it would be good if that stage had more and more voices. I think it is very invisible."

From the moment 01:11:56.580000 to 01:12:06.300000 Interviewer says: "for example the issue of white slave trafficking and so on. Because it is not palpable, it is not seen. It is like it passes beneath Society. and until someone comes and puts a camera on this. This is happening, with children. With society is not aware that this happens, look at white slavery because "

From the moment 01:12:11.060000 to 01:12:22.700000 Samuel Vázquez says: "it's called white slavery, we have Europe, for me it is the least racist continent on Earth, at least in Africa racism reaches tribal issues of a people with the People, next door, hatred and ending up killing each other with machetes, which among them is tremendous"

From the moment 01:12:28.300000 until 01:12:28.300000 Interviewer says: "racists everything that is the Maghreb with the south is the the the the mythical the mythical black Lives matters that"

From the moment 01:12:36.440000 to 01:16:19.480000 Samuel Vázquez says: "it has its germ in those 80s in the early 90s in the Ronnie King incident. Before, the one with Latasha Williams but well the one with Rodney King who Much more was made because it was much more usable than that of Latasha Williams, that is, in the same period of time in Los Angeles. A North Korean shop assistant shoots a 12-year-old girl in the head, a shot in the head. , which the entire United States sees because the video was recorded, because he thought he was going to leave with a package of cookies without paying, when the girl had the money in her hand, a black girl... what impact does it have worldwide? ? or at the level in the United States. A week later a criminal is chased by a Group of Police, he is beaten by a recorder, because a boy who is on the other side of the sidewalk records it, and it seems to me after the arrival to the moon.and the assassination of Kennedy the most viewed video in the history of the United States.the Girl Latasha no, the Delinquent.yes why? because the criminal, who did not even die, who ended up receiving a million-dollar compensation and ended up dead in a pool drowned by drugs, how they resisted, how many confrontations had occurred. There is even a song by Ice Cube, which I don't remember the name, but it is related to Koreans, in which they are asked to go after Koreans directly... It talks about violence against Koreans, Koreatown, openly. Everything is born from a lie. Racism is racism. There are racist people everywhere, in all territories...Because of our training, because of the level we have managed to reach in the West and in Europe, here we are less racist than in the rest of the world. And white slavery is not called white slavery for nothing, it is because Berber pirates and because warriors from North Africa kidnapped thousands of white European women and took them to their continent to be sexual slaves. Thousands and thousands and thousands...But no one seems to… However, do I have to ask for forgiveness? Because ? And kneel on a football field or something? Because I don't know who in the United States... Do I have to apologize? Or because of my Hispanicity do I have to ask for forgiveness? the first time that a queen, the best queen that history has ever known, recognized the conquered, recognized that the conquered had the same rights as the conquerors, that she gave them the same status, the first time that they did not She treated them like slaves, which was Queen Isabella. Hispanidad, which is a magnum opus. Taking universities to where they had sacrifices, where they cut off the heads of their next-door neighbors and put them in pulpits, we carry them. universities, that we did. a genocide, but you have ever walked through Latin America, if 80% of the population is native or indigenous or mestizo, not only do we not kill them but we mix with them, genocide is perhaps it would be North America go look for Indians in the reserves and I have to kneel for that reason I for that magnum opus I and then those of North Africa for the Berber pirates who dragged thousands of women and kidnapped them for sexual pleasures because they kneel us They because they kneel us. They can't analyze history with the eyes of an 18-year-old kid or a professor from the Complutense University, a half-boborolo who has a head full of straw and we allow him to be vice president, but This is like Va. You can't analyze history in its context. And that's it, and if you don't know how to analyze it in its context, you don't know how to analyze it. Why isn't there formally?

From the instant 01:16:21.620000 to 01:16:27.160000 Interviewer says: "a mafia in Spain? Just like in other countries like Italy, Russia, a mafia as an institution, classically so to speak"

From the moment 01:16:32.340000 to 01:16:37.500000 Samuel Vázquez says: "I like the question and we are going to improvise it. Let's...Let me think for 30 seconds. You think about other countries and they have a structure of a consolidated mafia"

From the moment 01:16:37.500000 to 01:16:42.180000 Interviewer says: "You think about other countries and they have like a structure of a consolidated mafia. Yes, yes, yes, I have it, I have it in my head. And in Spain you don't have like that..."

From the moment 01:16:41 until 01:17:04.660000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Yes, yes, yes, I have it, I have it in my head. And in Spain you don't have anything like that...I have it in my head, Yes, look. Right now, according to the latest report. I don't remember which agency issued it. But we are the country that has grown the most. In terms of organized crime, okay? Silent, Silent. But what is it, that the organized crime What you are referring to is a native mafia, the Italian mafia. Let's put it that way, right?"

From the moment 01:17:04.660000 to 01:17:09.640000 Interviewer says: "let's say it like this, right? native to a territory that controls a territory. and that Territory is classic. I think it has to do with who we were the last"

From the moment 01:17:12.240000 to 01:19:23.160000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Of course, dictatorships have many bad things. Well, most things are Bad. In a dictatorship, Obviously. But then it has other good things For example, social control is much greater and for many things it is bad. I think that has influenced it. Italy has a very particular history, a very particular birth of the mafia in the south of Italy, with great success. in a very short time, which they also manage to make transactional in a time where globalism did not yet exist... However, mass immigration from America manages to also impose itself in America, that is, the success is doubled, the amount of The money generated is doubled and everything is very successful in a very short time. The Russian mafia has more to do with an absolutely ossified political system that was collapsing and collapsing and when there is no firm authority, other types of authorities appear that impose themselves , which are generally criminal groups... I would have to study that. Why not in Spain. But I think we are in danger. Not from a native mafia, we are no longer in that criminal scenario, that is, not even If Italy could be reset, today there would not be an Italian mafia, today it would be impossible. Now we are a Global world. The mafias are very different. And I believe that in Spain, we run a risk of more silent organized criminal groups. that the mafia, which is very well known, but they are there. In the Netherlands I think it is happening with the issue of drug trafficking. No longer silent. But confirmed. A confirmed danger. And in the end everything derives from the same thing. The authority . That authority. Only if it can be imposed by force. How ugly this is. You say this to a conspirator. "They throw you out of the assembly"

From the moment 01:19:26.820000 until 01:19:26.820000 Interviewer says: "They throw you out of the assembly"

From the moment 01:19:28.600000 to 01:23:37.640000 Samuel Vázquez says: "clearly, come on. The assembly that they believe is a method of perfecting democracy and it is not...The Assembly is a method of.localization of dissidence, right? the Assembly has no other leitmotif, which is that one or two, who are the ones with the megaphone, speak and the rest obey, because when you are in a human group, very Few people dare to speak, dare to raise their voices. And those who dare to raise their voices are already identified as dissidents. That is the Foundation of the Assembly, not to improve democracy. But hey, for go to the Topic, Authority is only authority if it can be imposed by Force. This is ugly and for that you have your police and your army. When you do not consent, when you do not allow, when you put obstacles. When you question each police action with videos manipulated. Where you only see the last part, the last two minutes, the Repressive part. But you don't see what is before that repressive part. When you raise this to the Media level. That is, many journalists do that, it you raise it to a Political level. That is to say, members even of the government permanently question that authority. If you cannot impose it by force, You Lose it. The moment you negotiate it, You Lose it. It is already there, and when You Lose it. It never stays. In Limbo, it is the mafia, it is the Organized groups. Someone always wins. If you do not impose it on a territory. It is a matter of time, very few years. When that territory ends up imposing. Another authority, and that is a no Go zone. that is a no Go zone. a no go zone is an area where the Traditional authority of the West, judges and police, no longer exists... And a New authority has been imposed. A new authority that, depending on where the no-go zone is, may be a criminal gang, may be a mafia group, or may be a radical Sharia group. But that's a no-go zone. That is why it is so important to defend those who maintain authority. And I'm sorry, to maintain authority, you are going to see violent scenes. We're going to have to use force...I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you...There are so many people in the Institutions that are peaceful, right? I hear them speak to these ministers, ministers and ministers that we have, then some of them come out there, I know, I have ever heard Belarra or one of these with this immense resume that they have in everything, business capacity, creation of companies, books written, an outrage... And we have allowed them to govern the country. And he says, no, I am against violence, I am a peaceful person. I say, let's see, my daughter, what capacities do you have for violence? Do you have weapons, use of weapons? Have you learned to handle them? Armed confrontations? Have you used violence many times in your life? Have you belonged to a security force or body? Do you have combat experience? Do you do combat sports? Nothing, absolutely nothing...Pacific is me. That I know how to handle firearms and I have faced them. I have had violent confrontations. Many times during my life. I have certain tools for violence. But I decide not to use them, unless it is my own defense. That of third parties, I decide not to use them. I prefer to talk to you. I can say that I am peaceful. Yone, you can't, you are harmless. The wolves. Grossman already said it. It is not an insult, it is a way of dividing society. In terms of processes of violence. Grossman, who is one of the greatest experts on violence in the world, said that society is divided into sheep, wolves and shepherd dogs. The vast majority of society are sheep. They do not have any capacity for violence. They do not need it, They believe that the State is going to make up for that lack. Why? because they have their lives, they have to go all day to the Butcher Shop, to the bar, to the hairdresser, to work. That is what Grossman calls Sheep...There is a small part of society that does have the capacity for violence and decides to use it for its own benefit...Those are the wolves. Faced with those, we have to have another small part of the population who also have the capacity for violence and who are allowed to use it. Those are the sheepdogs...If you tie the sheepdogs. The wolves will do the rest of the work."

From the moment 01:23:46.160000 to 01:23:47.840000 Interviewer says: "Yes. Seeing a little how the situation is in the United States. Yes, yes, yes"

From the moment 01:23:49.820000 until 01:25:08.760000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Because the United States is the country that carries them to everything. But it carries them to everything, everything. Cinema, food, industry and crime. And what happens in the United States. In fact, the vast majority of these stupidities. UOC and such that are seen in our universities. They are born from the University laboratories. of the United States. and fentanyl is. hitting very hard in the United States. United. Is there a risk of living again. a stage like that of the heroine of the 80s? We have more. information, it is true, okay? That is. a defense mechanism that we have. but there is a risk, because This type of things. I have already seen some reports in Barcelona that there may already be some cases. They don't introduce it to you. You take fentanyl. Why? Because nowadays everyone has YouTube, even the drug addict. and see, I can't take this because look where it takes me... and in the next dose of what they give you, they put something in... the person who receives it says, uuuh, I liked this, a little bit more. And there comes a moment when you say, but what is this? o.your life is going to be hell...We have the heroine experience, okay? "We are going to believe that we are going to know how to use it, we are going to believe, we are going to pray because our elites are going to know how to use it...But the danger is there, the danger is latent and real."

From the moment 01:25:12.460000 to 01:25:29.440000 Interviewer says: "The question is how a drug that itself is from the medical environment, that any doctor can tell you. This is not something from the street, this is not something that has come from a guy who has started to make formulation, but something that comes from the medical environment, which is used at very strong anesthesia levels, how did that get to the street? Well, the question is good. It is that we live in, of course, the current world has changed so much in such a short time. I always say that the advances of the last 20 years, in technological terms, in terms of highways, in communication, would take five centuries long ago to achieve. "

From the moment 01:26:02.640000 to 01:26:52.120000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Pharmaceutical companies are still large multinationals as well. And a large multinational, obviously, has a health vision of what it means to look after the population, but He also has a business economic vision that sometimes is not the best...it is difficult.It is difficult to analyze that Problem.because I am sure that in order to get there.so that it reaches the Street.so that it reaches the Smith of Shift.de Oklahoma, there is the poor Man lying on the Street. Above that there has been a process of corruption that involves political elites, that involves economic elites, that involves multinationals, too, because we are not going to say it, here you are. and I, sitting at this table, would have to do a lot of field work."

From time 01:26:54.200000 to 01:26:58.660000 Interviewer says: "There is a jump from, okay, I have problems in the United States with opioids, to fentanyl. It's a huge jump."

From the moment 01:27:00.580000 to 01:27:03.280000 Samuel Vázquez says: "It's not just that it's huge, it's that it was very fast... It seems to me that it was very fast."

From instant 01:27:04.920000 to 01:27:04.920000 Interviewer says: "Extremely fast. And because it was"

From the moment 01:27:06.620000 to 01:28:06.780000 Samuel Vázquez says: "very quickly, I distrust that the process is natural. I distrust...I don't have it, I'm a person, I don't have evidence here to tell me. The president of the United States is poisoning its population. No, no, I am. I, a Cosperano, who also do not fit into that... It is difficult for me to believe that it was so fast... There are neighborhoods and cities in which, according to the videos they send us from the United States, it looks like the Zombie apocalypse... It looks like this series, I don't remember its name... The Walking Dead... It looks like The Walking Dead... It seems like The Walking Dead...and I tend to distrust certain elites when that happens like that, because sometimes there are certain intentions behind anesthetizing a certain part of the population for whatever reasons.so I don't know.I don't know. "I still have enough analysis capacity to give certainty about this, I have doubts, many doubts, but no certainty. They talked about trying to put an end to the whole problem."

From the moment 01:28:09.480000 to 01:28:12.360000 Interviewer says: "about the Homeless that they have in the United States. releasing the fentanyl. how hard, how hard, how hard, but how hard, but I have always said that everything must be analyzed all"

From the moment 01:28:19.920000 to 01:28:45.700000 Samuel Vázquez says: "theory must be analyzed, that is, it is not valid here, you don't have to, the power tells you that you can only talk about this and no no no no no if that It exists as a theory, you have to analyze it, no matter how hard it is, and if it is not perfect, it would be better for everyone because it is because recognizing that is extremely serious, but I would be in favor of doing as much analysis as possible because we live in. the world I no longer trust anyone I no longer trust anyone it is surreal what has happened in

From the moment 01:28:49.840000 to 01:28:49.840000 Interviewer says: "the last four years are a level of events and too fast everything is true"

From the moment 01:28:53.800000 to 01:29:36.500000 Samuel Vázquez says: "too much like this and this has also been said by Bukele, true because when he talks about crime and goes to the United States it hurts them it hurts what they He says but he says the rapid deterioration of certain territories, the criminal degradation of certain territories Bukele says No, I don't think they are spontaneous, this is because the power wants this to be the case, there must be a certain part of complicity, if not, it is absolutely impossible. he has he is not me I am not. no authoritative voice he is he has abruptly reversed crime levels in a very few years that is to say he has the authority to say I know that this can be done and I also know that Yes. "If you don't do it, it's because you're an accomplice. It could also be because if chaos ensues."

From the moment 01:29:42.320000 to 01:29:51.080000 Interviewer says: "the Government has more capacity to intervene and on that part to cut freedoms. or to have, let's say, more tied to the population, then if you are looking for a "excuse that generates insecurity and fear of people, you have the ability to intervene in people, fear is a weapon"

From the moment 01:29:55.320000 to 01:32:44.800000 Samuel Vázquez says: "very dangerous and dangerous, fear is a very powerful weapon, well we have seen it recently with him. Fear is a very dangerous and powerful weapon and obviously there are certain ideologies policies that survive chaos very well, that emerge stronger from chaos and whose arguments and whose real plan are nothing similar...Because here we have the most progressive government in history, as everyone knows because they told us so, that they did not want a citizen security law because it was a gag law, but that it is the government that has used a citizen security law the most in the history of our democracy...so, these things must be analyzed. and we must see them with Perspective.was a Government.of welcome Refugees.that pointed out as racist all of us who.saw a problem in the Processes.overflowed.and who called Fact.returns in Hot.they put bad names to everything I don't want.returns. in hot terms to the Rejections in Frontera and they told us that this was Unacceptable, but it is the government with the most rejections in Frontera in the history of our democracy. Just the assault on Ceuta, well, it's already outrageous... So, between what they say and what they do, between what they defend and then what they use. For the control systems that you were talking about, how do you get out? this? We have a very big problem, because half of the population in Spain does not judge their leaders by their actions, they judge them by their ideals, by what they tell you they are going to do...Politics of gestures...Yes, yes, gestures. I come here to end hunger. Okay, but you've been here for four years and hunger has doubled. They don't judge him for that. For having doubled the number of hungry people. No no no . Which is that this guy I vote for says he's going to end hunger. But when will hunger end? So we have a problem with that. We have a very big problem because it seems that half of the population is anesthetized...So you have a government that fails in everything, economically, in controlling the pandemic, that releases rapists into the streets when it has a specific ministry to avoid that type of thing, that commits all kinds of outrages, that speaks against corruption and changes the Penal Code to benefit embezzlers, to benefit the corrupt, that speaks to you against this and then gives amnesty to those of its own, that speaks to you about classism but it makes some laws and amnesty to those... to some politicians in Function. of what they are for. certain crimes, but not to other ordinary Citizens. And the People don't care, because an election has come... and who has judged these People for what they have done? Half of the population does not. It is evident that the Half has judged them by what they say they are going to do... Or by what they believe in, by ideals... but what they have done is what they have done, my son... It is What they have done is there, it is palpable."

From the moment 01:32:48.700000 to 01:32:57.840000 Interviewer says: "Be Pedro Sánchez and say, I can lie, I can do whatever I want, I can deceive people and they still vote for me, I get a better result and I can rule...And continue ruling. In other words, you feel invincible. It is a sensation of absolute omnipotence."

From the moment 01:33:10.580000 to 01:33:22.640000 Samuel Vázquez says: "the most Mediocre.the Most.I don't know. Sánchez Is.I Mime with me.and He does everything.for Sánchez.and for Being.ten minutes more.would.sell.I believe.that.transcends ideology"

From the moment 01:33:22.640000 to 01:33:24.100000 Interviewer says: "it transcends ideology. That is, Sánchez. His ideology is the same"

From the moment 01:33:24.100000 to 01:36:03.280000 Samuel Vázquez says: "his ideology is the Same. nothing nothing. I no longer blame Socialism. no no no. this is Sánchez. this is Sánchez .and Sánchez.as we say in Asturias.he would be able to sell.to anyone.for a plate of Lentejes.is Saying.He Sells.for half an hour more.in power.sells anything.and Negotiates.peace is with whoever it is, even if those hands are stained with blood and then you have to understand that their partners come from where they come from and are what they are and the violence on the part of their partners is a fundamental fact to define them now we are with the never but There is also the Basque country.eta and what they are doing now with Bildu Podemos Podemos. The candidate for mayor of Ávila de Podemos, it was discovered in the middle of the campaign that she had been convicted of homicide in the 1990s. Logically, rationally, whatever party you belong to, neither left nor right, immediately apart from that candidate, they sent Chenique to reinforce her and to say that she had killed her then partner because he was a sexist and because he. hit, which later the family had to report again. Hey, my son has never been, he is dead, but he has never been convicted for this, what these people say. These People accept Violence when Violence is applied by their own and they criticize it when it is applied by those in front of them and sensible people cannot accept that. If the party I vote for has been convicted of Homicide and my party does not immediately stop that Candidate, I will not vote for that party again, but how am I going to vote? I have some ethical and moral principles that govern my life. Of course, they. What do they have instead of ethical and moral principles? Absolute relativism, everything relative. Here everything is relative, nothing. The transcendentals no longer exist, what my dearest and my favorite columnist Esperanza Ruiz would say. The transcendentals, those that we considered sacred, which were like that just because. This no longer exists. Now you can feel like anything, an Amazon alligator... I'm an Amazon alligator, tattoo me here with an alligator crest. And respect me that I'm an Amazon alligator. But man, respect yourself first, I who know, no, no, no, no, I respect you, and you may be a Carmen from the Amazon, but don't ask me to share your vision of life and the world, because I don't share it, because no, you can believe it, I Respect, but I don't believe that you are an Amazon alligator, I'm very sorry, you are Manolo, and I've known you all my life, you know? sacred, we have lost track of the difference between good and evil. That no longer exists, 50 years ago. This is what happens with relativism."

From the moment 01:36:04.480000 to 01:36:08.880000 Interviewer says: "it is an absurdity that already ends. with a greater absurdity and a greater absurdity. and we are already in Brian's life, we are in the movie"

From the moment 01:36:11.480000 to 01:36:52.940000 Samuel Vázquez says: "and the film is no longer a Film. It is your Life, the film of Brian's life. or here, these films that Berlanga made. this is already It is not a Movie. This is Real Life. And you now see passages that are happening. In real life and that are taken. As something serious and that you cannot. Criticize or oppose It. Because They cut you off Civilly. That These are passages that caused laughter in the films about the life of Brian and the National Shotgun and All of these things, it's a world, it's a world, indeed, relativism, how bad it is that relativism prevails, How bad it is that they cut off our principles, our values, our ethics, the place where our ethics come from. How bad it is. For society, we are suffering. By settling Samuel, we have "

From the moment 01:36:55.400000 to 01:37:14.680000 Interviewer says: "a few weeks a little complicated with the issue of terrorism and so on. Are there signs of concern regarding the situation in Spain, regarding terrorism? I get a lot of people who say, Damn Victor, I'm afraid of going out this weekend, I'm afraid of taking the train. Is there really a palpable concern? Look, me."

From the moment 01:37:17.100000 to 01:39:05.380000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Of course, it is easy to be accused of alarmism if you talk about this, okay? Be worried. The world is changing very quickly, the Threat. is We have inside our house. And we should be worried. And that does not mean alarming, what I want is for my leaders to inform. To inform with the truth, because we are adults. And we will know how to manage that Truth. We will know, if it is not even It's a question of finding culprits, it's a question of having all the information about what could happen to us, right now. The MTV shows that were going to be held in Paris have just been suspended and I wonder why. Could it be? because they have. Information or intelligence. That implies. What could happen at those airports? But not the butcher of Marseille? Why the butcher of Marseille. Who can also take a plane. Doesn't he also have that information from his Government? It's just that the butcher of Marseille doesn't pay taxes. It's that only Lady Gaga pays them. It's good to protect the artists. And to protect the Singers. But we have to protect everyone. So I only ask my Government. .give me real and reliable information about what can happen.and I'm not even going to blame him.if a wolf comes to attack here.I'm not going to blame Pedro Sánchez.but I want to have information. I do not want all those who try to give information to be singled out and told that you are an alarmist. That cannot be done. No, no, No. Inform me really. If I am a citizen of Paris. I want to know why MTV has been suspended. Because? for it to be suspended. But the same day I leave by plane, the artists don't fly and six airports are closed."

From the moment 01:39:06.900000 to 01:39:09.560000 Interviewer says: "And in theory that is an Awards gala that will have extreme security."

From the moment 01:39:11.680000 to 01:39:35.620000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Enormous. I have my personal opinion...It is not a fact...It is an opinion. I think they would be afraid. They cannot be fear of the gala...The gala is equipped with security levels that make it insurmountable...It is the government's obligation not to treat you like a child, but to give you real and truthful information. And if not, it is a bad government "

From the moment 01:39:51.520000 until 01:39:51.520000 Interviewer says: "fear"

From the moment 01:39:55.280000 to 01:41:22.960000 Samuel Vázquez says: "alert 5 implies one thing, military deployment. something that has already been deployed in Paris. for years, something that they have also in other European countries for years.well,unfortunately.and this is another personal opinion,I believe that the Partners.of the Government do not accept the Military deployment.they put the anti-pilitarian.Speech first,we start Talking.about This.it makes no sense,we start talking about This. We work to protect political speeches and power structures and not to protect citizens, right? It was our first question in this talk. Well, this is the same... They have a speech against the military... So They do not want to see soldiers in the streets, and they put that speech before the protection of citizens. What fear is there of raising alert 5 just as Europe is right now? We are seeing an attack every four hours, whether it is more serious or not. or less serious...Israel, what happened? How is the strip now? Man, what is this? So why don't we upload it? 5 is just a number. We did not raise it Because.5 implies deploying reinforced military.4,4.yes there are certain critical points.that are reinforced more, true, and that we must have.but the military presence for that.to reverse crime, not the military. You can't deploy them for that. But to protect Critical points. They have a proven success, and therefore. That would free up hundreds of Police officers. To protect Citizen security tasks. And also to protect us from this type of Wolves. They are attacking in Europe, it is not a bad Idea. Someone tells me, they have criticized me. for a television intervention on Yesterday. in which I said something similar to This. It has given them time to criticize you"

From the moment 01:41:24.100000 until 01:41:24.100000 Interviewer says: "2-5 minutes after you say it"

From the moment 01:41:26.840000 to 01:41:41.100000 Samuel Vázquez says: "You have no idea, you are ignorant. Well, let's see who is talking to me, maybe he is an eminence. It is the bread of the moment, the one from Barrio .and he says, you have no idea. You are ignorant, alert 5. is only after a massive terrorist attack like the Ramblas. Well, let's wait until there is one."

From the moment 01:41:42.900000 to 01:41:44.440000 Interviewer says: "to avoid it. Look at you madam, this is a crazy idea"

From the moment 01:41:46.900000 to 01:41:59.080000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Just like a crazy idea. Mine, which I have no idea. Maybe it's better to put the alert before they kill 100 people on the trains "I have to put it later. Like a crazy idea, huh? If you don't like it, if it offends you... We're talking about taking out the military as if we were going to take the lions out into the street."

From the moment 01:42:02.220000 to 01:42:02.220000 Interviewer says: "Exactly. But when one has an anti-militarist speech, when one does not want the armies because I don't know who is going to defend us from these wolves if there are no armies..."

From the moment 01:42:13.940000 until 01:42:49 Samuel Vázquez says: "Because of course, then to say, now that we are having a bad time, take the military out on the streets, not marry... With your voters, that It can have a cost, right? And we are going to assume a cost...How am I going to assume a cost, minister of I don't know what, director general, secretary of state of I don't know what, if they kick me out of here where they hire me to me? I have heard somewhere that they also say that it reduces consumption...I know that in the police, in the Military, in everything, in the areas of life, prioritizing protection. of political speech is bad for Citizens "On foot, for ordinary citizens. The neighborhood. Prioritize money over safety."

From the moment 01:42:51.060000 until 01:42:51.060000 Interviewer says: "it's bad, bad"

From the moment 01:42:53.340000 to 01:43:09.740000 Samuel Vázquez says: "and I don't care about the speech anymore. Citizens have to know if there is a Real alert. If there is information, if there is intelligence that is Telling us .that there is a possible...it has been leaked recently, four days ago.that 300 lone wolves may be circulating in our country. If that threat is...and are they really controlled? Or is it?

From time 01:43:09.740000 to 01:43:11.340000 Interviewer says: "And are they really controlled? Or is it that I know there is a lone wolf. Is there really a control?"

From the moment 01:43:15.360000 to 01:44:30.440000 Samuel Vázquez says: "let's talk about names, the units that are dedicated to this, and so on, but I'm going to tell you one thing... Also, I'll tell you I mean, I think that with some knowledge... If there are no more tragedies here, because the people who are in charge of this Control are Units, a very effective job... That is to say, we are not left here at the feet. ..The problem is that if you have 300, controlling them all at all times is very difficult. What I have always said is because they are allowed to be there because they are allowed. They arrive expecting them to do something clear but it cannot be this. like the returnees or some of the biggest threats that Europe has suffered in recent decades are the returnees and yet we allow them to continue coming in. Let's see, you live in Seville and you go to Syria for two years when the war in Syria is not that my mother is Syrian no you have not gone on vacation to Syria what have you done in Syria for two years now you come back here you are allowed to enter I have not done anything in Spain I have no crime. But what have you done for two years in Syria? You cannot be allowed to enter Sweden, and we are doing all the bad things that Sweden did, and we are heading towards Sweden and France, if we don't change now... A few years ago it was detected that there were returnees in schools. . Returnees from conflict zones. Working in teacher schools?"

From the moment 01:44:32.800000 to 01:45:24.800000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Of caregivers, of the Dining Rooms, of Technicians, of... Sorry, you, gentleman. You are... Where are you? Sirio How long have you been in Spain? I've been in Seville for 10 years, okay...The war has broken out in Syria. There are Islamist groups in Syria. There are Radical groups in Syria. I'm going to Syria for two years. You're leaving. to Syria for two years. There's the ticket, there's the plane... You're not coming back here. You're not coming back here. I haven't committed any Crime. in Spain, it doesn't matter to me. That I can't dedicate thousands. of euros to follow you 365 days a year so that you don't kill us... Which can't be... We don't even have a strict returnee policy... Some, it can be seen, have participated in organizations and so on, they are stopped. When they arrive, okay. But not all... Unless a strong man, a brave man, a man capable of making decisions, and being willing to add up, to assume the risk of those decisions, appears soon. We will be worse and worse...Let us pray that a strong man appears soon. "That strong man, I already mentioned it, is not Pedro Sánchez."

From the moment 01:44:32.800000 until 01:44:32.800000 Interviewer says: "Of caretakers, of the dining rooms,"

From the moment 01:45:34.060000 to 01:45:36.320000 Interviewer says: "Well, let's see, I'm not a grandfather either, but when we were younger... I'm very old, your camera says so."

From the moment 01:45:36.320000 to 01:45:37.400000 Samuel Vázquez says: "I am very old, your camera says so...watch the Swat movie"

From the moment 01:45:39.800000 to 01:45:50.860000 Interviewer says: "and say, I want to be like them. How difficult is it to become a Swat, a GEO? What level of preparation or complexity What does a person like that have to be like? At the level of aptitudes. Physically. It's very difficult, it's like when the"

From the moment 01:45:53.640000 to 01:46:07.240000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Mother and father take the Boy to Soccer school. It's good, because he has to play sports, it's very good. But you have to tell him clearly that Cristiano Ronaldo, there is one, okay? and that 30,000 wanted him to be a Christian, but they didn't become Christians. In Spain there are two hundred and twenty thousand police officers, but there are none. You need physical and mental preparation, some processes strong mental, you need also very strong technical processes, not just anyone will do."

From the moment 01:46:23.040000 to 01:46:29.280000 Interviewer says: "Is all this they say true, that they throw them into the sea and look for a life, they pick them up, one day they kidnap them, things like that, to see Let's see if they hold up? I don't really like to talk about the formation of these types of groups, that's why I don't really like that there has been a series, as you know, I don't like it, I think certain things shouldn't have been taught. OK? But yes, you have to subject them to strong mental processes to know that when the time comes they will know how to act."

From the moment 01:46:47.040000 to 01:49:16.420000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Human beings have three basic instincts when faced with a vital situation. If a man appears here now, he opens the door with a Kalashnikov and points it at us, or with a knife and points it at us to kill us... We have the podcast of the year... If we manage to edit it, yes. If that happens, the human being has three responses. Paralysis, flight or confrontation. Those are the three answers that a human being has. A geo is only worth confrontation... it is because your brain has entered an atavistic phase, that is, that is why we condemn innocent people. the brain tells you, you don't know, you don't. You have no idea. Yes, I am not going to allow you to Reason. Because if you reason you are going to Die. Everything you do from now on is going to be with a click, it is going to be instinctive. And it is going to come from the Atavistic. What you have been doing for centuries and centuries. We have not survived as a Species. Because we are proportional, we have survived. Because we have known how to defeat the threat. With disproportionality. Then you enter that atavistic phase. And the brain, alone, without you thinking about it. It pumps, paralyzes certain organs of the body. And it pumps a lot of blood to the legs. And to the arms. To the extremities, why? Because they are what we use to escape or to confront ourselves. And there we accumulate a lot, a lot of strength. Those processes. And how did we get here? Speaking of the geo. You have to know that you are not going to paralyze yourself. You have to know that you are not going to run away. But you also have to know that you are going to know how to face that situation at that moment. And that not only goes into the physical. That goes into a lot of the mental. So, being a police officer. It's the most beautiful thing in the world. For 20 years answering your neighbors' Notices, it's Addictive. It's beautiful, you don't have to be a Geo, and if then you're an outlier, I wasn't an outlier. Therefore, I have never been able to access the Geo, but there are people who are out of this world, mentally and physically, because you can't try because not knowing that very few Cristiano Ronaldo's enter, they are the ones who are and work in Yes, many already have many operations a year because I imagine"

From the moment 01:49:22.200000 until 01:49:22.200000 Interviewer says: "they will be very specific things, they don't have much work but they do it very well because they have"

From the moment 01:49:27.320000 to 01:52:23.900000 Samuel Vázquez says: "a lot of training, training is constant so that when the day arrives they are absolutely prepared. Let's see how we explain this. We had talked about the reactions of the human being. In the face of danger, the truth of three reactions is as a strategy what you can do to confront that threat, that guy who is going to come in there with a machete, what I am going to do once I see eye contact. The pulse increases the adrenaline, there are some psychophysical processes, okay, I'm only going to be able to do one thing, everything that has incorporated A. into mechanical memory, that is to say, what I have constantly trained for years, I have repeated thousands and thousands and thousands of times, that is incorporated into Your mechanical memory comes out by instinct, you don't need to think about it because if you start thinking you're dead, so if you've trained it, it will be founded quickly for thousands and thousands and thousands of times when you see him enter. Yes, you have a weapon here. A normal police officer may forget due to stress until he is alarmed. But a person who is used to it. An elite agent may do this. It is because he has it incorporated. In his mechanical memory. Or I don't know if he is already condemned. To a old man from Ciudad Real. who defended himself in his house with a shotgun. well, this citizen of Ciudad Real. at 3 in the morning he goes outside and sees an Intruder. in his plot, at night. the Rational. proportional is nullified In the trial, we are like donkeys... An atavistic, instinctive phase passes... They tell him, no, it's just that he came in to recharge... Why didn't he go in to make a phone call? You don't know what you're talking about, boy. You don't know what you're talking about... He can only perform, Externalize the actions that he has incorporated into his mechanical memory... Is it incorporated into his Mechanical memory by calling 091? No . How many times has he been able to do it in his life? One... I have responded to notices and I got there and the neighbor told me, I had to call because he didn't remember the number... When you are in acute stress, come by... and dial 091? Loss of fine motor skills, one of the first things that happens in a stressful situation... You don't manage your fingers well, okay? What he has repeated constantly since he was 14. Thousands and thousands of times... He was a hunter... He had reloaded his gun thousands and thousands of times... If you put him in the middle of a nightclub, with the music at full blast, without light, with Flashes, and you give him the shotgun and put a blindfold on him, he reloads the shotgun... He does it instinctively, he has done it thousands and thousands of times. and he has it incorporated into his mechanical memory. ..That's why go in and recharge. It's his way of nullifying the threat... The brain is telling him not to negotiate, don't look for ways out or proportionality, do what you know how to do and you're going to do it well... he takes the shotgun, reloads and shoots. He nullifies the threat... It is not a will, it does not come from the volitional, it comes from the irrational, the atavistic... The brain is ordering it by instinct. And yet we put him in jail. There is no right"

From the moment 01:52:27.920000 to 01:52:39.740000 Interviewer says: "Experienced in hand-to-hand combat? Or do they simply train weapons? No, no, no, they train body. In the sense of being able to reach the best. "To catch a geo and face one of the UFC. And they can compete, for example. Uhhh, one of the UFC."

From the moment 01:52:43.320000 to 01:52:44.960000 Interviewer says: "A little for comparison. Mmmmm, no"

From the moment 01:52:43.320000 to 01:52:43.320000 Samuel Vázquez says: "A little for comparison"

From the moment 01:52:47.040000 to 01:53:49.240000 Samuel Vázquez says: "No, no, because we are talking about a person who dedicates his entire life to that, a geo needs many more things when it comes to train, he can train.that one hour a day.but Khabib trains.12 hours a day that.of course, it's like asking Khabib.to face a geo.at a distance of 20 meters each with a gun.a See who die, Khabib dies. I am absolutely sure that Khabib dies. but if you put them in an Octagon. I would not bet on the geo, I'm sorry. although he is my partner, but I would not bet on the geo. Then it is true that there are also geos. For example, the current head of the geos, Luis Esteban Lezao, is a born warrior, he is a person who has a lot of operational experience, he has been in groups, before he was in Goes, he has been in high-level research groups, He is what is known as a warrior... and I am also sure that he has done contact sports and combat sports and he will have done Boxing. But that is already part of the Personal heritage. Not all Geos have done it from youth to boxing or jiu jitsu is the best, there are others that do. And does it have an age limit in the sense of saying "

From the moment 01:53:51.940000 to 01:53:51.940000 Interviewer says: "Do you already have to retire after a certain age?"

From the moment 01:53:54.460000 to 01:55:08.800000 Samuel Vázquez says: "by law you can no longer put age limits on anything, that's what the head of the unit and common sense give. I imagine that that was also, you know. when you have reached the limit of things. and more so at those levels. It is a very small unit, very specialized and that immediately acts as a group. Therefore, if you act in a team and your team is six and you have a series of actions, you don't have to be very smart so that if one of the six screws begins to fail, the six will immediately realize that one of the screws begins to fail and the screw itself is the who knows that I'm no longer up to the task...so I don't think there's much of a problem in figuring that out. I don't think there's much of a problem, it's not a question of age, age today. It's not like age. of our Parents. You saw them after having worked. So many years, after such, at 50 years old. It seems that they were 80 years old today, it is that today you see. 50 year old people who Climb. peaks, mountains, who do boxing ,judicio.sport,crossfit,you see them and they are.athletes,authentic athletes,it is not a question of age,it is a question of the body at some point saying enough is enough and sometimes it is not the body,sometimes it is .vitals . In life, as I know, a separation that you don't know how to manage. Any other process, a death of a being that you don't know how to manage. And you can't be in the geo like that...You can't. You have to have obvious mental strength, right? Well, Samuel, I believe."

From the moment 01:55:14.860000 to 01:55:53.460000 Samuel Vázquez says: "Well, one last message. Yes, I would like to send one last message... Hard and bad years are coming in Terms of Crime. Let's go Let's see things that we had never seen before...France took a little longer, but it was 15-20 years. We are now in the second or third year of that absolute loss of control...That is to say, it is a matter of very Very little time. Please wake up and try to look beyond ideologies for a guy in politics, a guy, a strong man who is willing to truly reverse criminal policy and the police model, because the life of "Your son does not depend on an ideology. Ideology, when the wolf is in your neighborhood, will not save him. A police officer does, ideology will not save him for sure."

From the moment 01:56:21.300000 to 01:56:51.200000 Interviewer says: "I will leave you Samuel's networks here. Both his organization and your personal networks. And nothing, thank you very much Samuel. Because I believe that he has It was an incredible interview. And nothing, thank you very much. The work you do and have done. Because I think it is very important. I think we are now faced with a situation in which these messages need to be given the maximum possible visibility. Because I think we are in a moment in which it can be reversed. But if we continue like this, I think we will end up like Sweden."
