"From the moment 00:00:05.360000 to 00:00:07.760000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And I believe that those years were thrown away...I have heard Syria, the prison...\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:00:10.640000 to 00:00:12.160000 Interviewer says: \"Where do you start? Because this is very broad, eh...Well, a very moviey summary.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:00:12.160000 to 00:00:15.520000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Well, a very funny summary... I am also from a nation that is called, well, it is called communist reconstruction at that time \"\n\nFrom the moment 00:00:18.880000 to 00:00:29.680000 Interviewer says: \"To go fight against the Islamic State...You said fight against the Islamic State and today in today's society, fighting can be putting... \"No, fight with a rifle in the front, yes, yes... So you weren't tweeting, you were in the trench... There were people, yes, who were in the trench.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:00:25.040000 to 00:00:29.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"No, fight with a rifle in the front, yes, yes... So you weren't tweeting, you were in the trench... There was people, yes, who were in the trench.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:00:31.200000 until 00:00:31.200000 Interviewer says: \"Would you say that a revolution is needed?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:00:33.760000 to 00:01:07.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Now those who rule, in many cases are people who say they are women and who have displaced what could be called biological women...And they don't Not only that, but they call them Terf, that is, worse than the Nazis, and they are going to stick them in places... We live in a dystopian situation in all areas... Immigration model, the question of women , the education of children by hypersexualizing them, by putting horrible theories, from my point of view, into their heads... Weakness is being encouraged, there are people who are ashamed of being Spanish, there are people who are ashamed of being white, there are people who is ashamed of being otorosexual, there comes a time when it is ridiculous... Something that I really liked about your speech is the defense of the flag, Damn, because for me this is pure common sense.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:01:14.240000 to 00:01:14.240000 Interviewer says: \"The social communists, Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Podemos, make me laugh, and the fascists are everyone else.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:01:20 until 00:01:20 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And there are no fascists or communists there, it's like a scam, they are laughing at the people.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:01:25.680000 to 00:03:02.480000 Interviewer says: \"How are you? Is everything okay? Nice to be here...We are trying to make a little electoral content, so that our listeners have a little a clear vision, you know? I see that the media, in the end, today are very manipulated... And we are trying to make a little electoral content, so that our listeners have a clear vision a little, you know? In the end, today they are very manipulated, very biased... And the parties, whatever their type, do not normally have free space to express themselves calmly... So I would like to talk to you about two things... For a part, of you, as a personal figure, and after the game that you have been representing, I also understand right now, right? And I must tell you that it seems to me, you know? That watching your game and, well, in particular your videos, what I have Seen from you, it seems to me that it is quite fresh air compared to what was seen... I mean, I see that lately, during recent times, it is like the population buys packages, you know? If you are from the left, you have to defend this, this and this... And if you are from the right, you have to defend this and this and this... And it is like there is no criterion... And your party, in the end, It's like it's a little confusing... I guess it's difficult to position, left, right, it has features, right? So at least I know we'll disagree on some things...But at least it feels like fresh air to me, you know? I think Spanish politics already smells sharp, finally, right? Here in Spain there is the partitocracy and there are the games of the right axis, I don't know if you will ask me about that later or not.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:03:08.640000 to 00:03:54.240000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"But it seems to me that it is like a game of puppets to deceive people...And deep down, although it seems that everything is very polarized and that they confront a lot, many times they defend essentially the same thing... And well, the Political Parliament is distributed by them, first of all for financing... Because since they have already been in power, they have the right, that is They have already had representation, they have the right to money, they have the right to more space, they have the right to many things that the parties that do not have representation or the new ones do not have... We have to collect signatures, for example, which is outrageous. ...We are going to present ourselves in 51 constituencies out of 52, we have only been missing Melilla...And of course, it is difficult to achieve. Then I see other parties that try and in such a short time it is impossible...So \"They play with an absolute advantage and what they do is perpetuate a little of what there is...So it is very difficult to have fresh air because as soon as there is a little they close the window.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:04:02.960000 to 00:04:05.520000 Interviewer says: \"Do you consider yourself, I suppose, outside of...? Yes, yes. I come from the most ultra-left and most radical left that anyone can give. see us imagine.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:04:05.520000 to 00:04:44.720000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Yes, yes. I come from the most ultra-left and most radical left that anyone who sees us can imagine...And I believe that those years They were thrown into the trash and I was risking things for things that really weren't even my own interests...And I came out very renegade from there. And I don't defend either the left or the right...I think it's a dichotomy that it is already out of date and that what there is is people dividing both those who are from the more Moderate left or right, as well as their radical versions, that when things happen in the end they always end up joining the big one...And we have broken with that...So some call us fascists, others call us communists, they call us everything, everyone, but they don't care much... We want to build something different and we do want to be a little bit of that fresh air that you were talking about.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:04:56.640000 to 00:06:07.240000 Interviewer says: \"We invited everyone. They were the first to volunteer...Now you are here and well, if before the elections we manage to bring Psoe ,Pp and whoever wants to come, well, great on our part...But something that I didn't like at all with the Vascal issue is the amount of Dm's that I have received from messages saying But how can you think of giving voice to this? Not only have they told me this with Vascal, but they tell me that we bring an aunt who says she is half a Martian... How do you think of giving her a voice? We bring anyone, any person... And I know that I They are going to say it with you too. Totally, totally... And I say, the argument they use is like it is dangerous... And I say, let's see, let's see what is dangerous is not listening to a little bit of everything and trying to extract what you consider to be positive from each of the arguments and have your own criteria and build your opinion, not buy what was said at the beginning of packages... Then I would invite the audience to listen without bias, to listen calmly to what What you and anyone else have to say and build your own opinion, because they literally seem like sheep to me...Everyone who is writing that to me. How do you think about giving it a voice? How can you think ? How can you think? Go fuck each other in the ass...I mean, I mean, you know, you understand what I'm saying, right?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:06:10.120000 to 00:06:52.640000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"There are not many people who have that attitude when they do that to them, that honors you...There is like a dictatorship of political correctness and as soon as you If you leave that single thought of those dogmas, you are immediately the worst thing you can imagine... And I think it is one thing that shows that we are in a decadent society and that I think we should break with that... Enough of that that there has to be a message and any alternative that there may be must be shot... And I think it is a mistake... That is, in the case of Bascar in a party that has representation, well I understand that they call it to places to talk...For example, when I go to Barcelona and other places they tell me about demonstrations and they try to hit me...I mean, it's a dystopia...It's a real dystopia because it's people who supposedly defend democracy, freedom of expression, etc., but they immediately point out anything as dangerous hate speech in a critical way, because in reality they don't really value what you say, but you are directly bad, you are dangerous, you are out, you can't have no space.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:07:04.760000 to 00:08:11.240000 Interviewer says: \"I come to listen to all points of view...I, for example, am a businessman, in fact I know that you have a more communist approach, I know You will be against what I do, but when I talk to you, I listen to your point of view, I will try to understand and also put myself in your place... And in the end, surely the conclusion will be that you are not right... I'm not right either, it's a matter of priorities...Maybe you prioritize the community...I prioritize...I'm more selfish, maybe, and it could be like that and that's it...But then we'll get into it in that...What I would like to start with is with your personal figure, with who Roberto Vaquero is, because they have told me a little bit of your story.and I think it's great...It's like a bit of a movie ...It's like a movie...And after you are a figure that attracts attention, accustomed to the politicians we are seeing, well you see \u00cd\u00f1igo Rej\u00f3n. And after you seem like you came out of Mortal Kombat, well tell us a little that...Outside of politics I have heard Syria, prison...Where do you start? Because this is very broad...Well, a very moviey summary.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:07:49.920000 to 00:10:13.120000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"It's like a movie...Where do you start? Because this is very broad...Well, a very moviey summary... If it is Syria, for example, we have always collaborated a lot with the Kurdish community...And Spain always has somewhat murky relations with Turkey, which is a country that for me is a dictatorship, but there will be people who will say that it is authoritarian, but well, it is not a place where people can do whatever they want...So here there also began to be persecution of the Kurdish community here...So, well, we said. This is what we have to start to organize with them and we started to work with them... They tapped my phones and everything in 2012-2013. simply for being with these people, for helping the people of the Kurdish community... When the State thing happens Islamic, well, we are people with many concerns in this sense... We are against Islamism, the Islamization of Spain and also in general... But when you say we, who are you? Well, we, the group that founded the Workers' Front, what was the Motor group, is the group where I come from... So, this we are talking about 2009, 2010, 2011, that is, that a job has already been done quite a long time...When the Islamic State thing happens, we, even our friends, our friends' relatives, are murdered in Syria...So, well, we are very affected by that...And in that context, I am of a relationship that is also called, well, it is called communist reconstruction at that time. And a call is made similar to that of the International brigades that existed in Spain, here in the Civil War, well, the same, but to go to fight against the Islamic State...So, they accuse me, well, in fact they say that it is approved, that is, I can say it, they tell me that I am the one who organized it..because people are going to fight there... And well, when they come back, they arrest them, they start to put pressure on us, they put us on trial based on all this. And for fighting against the Islamic State, they put us on trial... They put me on remand, I was only in preventive, that is, then I was not sentenced serving time... And at the end of a 27-year petition that they put me in, for being, I don't know, the bad guy at the end of the game, well it came to nothing, in a year and six months. and I'm still fighting to get clean... I mean, that's the situation I have now and...\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:10:16.120000 to 00:10:27.480000 Interviewer says: \"Look, I would like you to clarify one thing there, because you said fight against the Islamic State. And nowadays in today's society, fighting can be posting tweets ...So, you weren't tweeting, you were in the trenches...There were people, yes, who were in the trenches.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:10:25.040000 to 00:10:54.960000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"So, you weren't tweeting, you were in the trench... There were people, yes, who were in the trench... I think They are arrested for being the instigator or the Organizer. And I spent 49 days in anti-terrorist isolation. Festivals, everything happens to me there... In fact, people say that I should write a book about That, everything happens to me... And well, I was a certain way before I got there... Well, I was a guy who always trained a lot, I always gave a lot of importance to studying, training, etc.... What it is for me... Before from jail too...It was like that before...I had a shoulder injury, I stopped training\"\n\nFrom instant 00:10:52.440000 to 00:10:52.440000 Interviewer says: \"Before prison too.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:10:57.280000 to 00:11:41.280000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"and when they put me in jail, I started training a lot...And when I got out, well, I ended up competing...I started training qui posis I ended up competing... They told me that with my shoulder I couldn't train again... They made me do rehabilitation like an animal... I started training and I ended up competing... I stopped studying to start working back in the day...I left, I got a degree in geography in History, I got my master's degree and I'm doing my doctorate...I mean, I kind of disciplined myself a lot there...I mean, I was in itself a person, compared to a person who only goes out to parties and so on, was very organized...But when I left there, I came out transformed...I mean, I was a person who dedicated myself to working to achieve my goals. and not look at anything else...And I also dedicate myself to building myself, also to contribute to others...So, of course, instead of destroying me, what it made me was much stronger...I came out much stronger there, mentally and at all levels...And the people with whom you shared time in prison?\n\nFrom the moment 00:11:41.280000 to 00:11:46.760000 Interviewer says: \"And the people with whom you shared time in prison. Did you notice a similar effect or was it something in you that disciplined you and...No, In fact, I saw a lot of people break there.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:11:46.760000 to 00:12:02.360000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"No, in fact, I saw many people break there... From seeing people who were ten years old, maybe eleven... I was with a boy who had been in prison for the longest time. How old was I when I was there... I had been in prison for 31 years... And, of course, now I write to him, I send him things, I try to help... I mean, I try to do things to help people who are like this.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:12:05.480000 to 00:12:05.480000 Interviewer says: \"But I saw many broken people and I saw people who, despite having been there for a long time\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:12:09.440000 to 00:12:51.560000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"and being a little bad, they got ahead, they made an effort...So, I saw it as something of an example...I was there with people the kind that are scary... That is, I was with people, especially the first time I was in Soto, I was with Arcan tigers, I was with Albanian and Italian gangsters... I was with very curious people, I was with prisoners from ETA, I was with all kinds of people...And there were some of them that I learned a lot...And I also learned to relate in another way...I learned, for example, with this guy, who was Serbian, I learned to train in a different way, because he was a physical phenomenon...And I dedicated myself to doing that. I read, trained and prepared...And, in fact, when I left there, that is when I proposed the plan to do the workers' front and all this... I mean, it was actually a very short period, but very productive for me.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:12:55.480000 to 00:13:02.480000 Interviewer says: \"And going back, when they decide to go there, how many people leave? In other words, these are four crazy people who say from one day to the next. ..Well, it was...No, it was people who really loved...\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:02.480000 to 00:13:19.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Well, it was...No, it was people who really loved...How many people? Well, only two people appear in the trial ...So let's say that there are two of them...And they were there at the front with the International Brigade.and there were people from all countries...And the only country that faces trial is the only group ,it's us...In fact, the people who said they were like our bosses in other places...\"\n\nFrom instant 00:13:05.920000 to 00:13:05.920000 Interviewer says: \"How many people?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:23.240000 until 00:13:23.240000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"How does this thing about the International Brigade work?\"\n\nFrom instant 00:13:23.240000 to 00:13:23.240000 Interviewer says: \"How does this thing about the International Brigade work?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:28.680000 to 00:13:30.640000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"and people wrote for... Just like that? Yes.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:30 to 00:13:34.480000 Interviewer says: \"Just like that? Yes, but through groups, of course, because I didn't know who was going to get involved.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:34.480000 to 00:13:41.480000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Yes, but through groups, of course, because I didn't know who was going to get involved...But yes, and there were people from Italy, there were \"People from a lot of Germany, there were people from England, there were people from many countries.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:46.760000 to 00:13:49.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"No, it starts at the institute...I began to become politicized at the Institute, in student assemblies, a little in the anti-fascist thing at the beginning also .\"\n\nFrom time 00:13:46.760000 to 00:13:46.760000 Interviewer says: \"No, it starts in high school.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:49.680000 to 00:13:49.680000 Interviewer says: \"in student assemblies, a bit in the anti-fascist vibe at the beginning too.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:13:53.480000 until 00:15:54 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And in the end, I read more...I have always been a person who has read a lot, with many concerns...There are people who It's like a pack, right? They dress one way, they talk one way, they go to concerts, they like it a lot... I started there, but I soon started to be like the weird one. And I started having problems from there. the beginning...And I was moving away, moving away until I founded an organization in itself, which is a bit of the embryo of everything we are now...I mean, it has been like a process of Rupture. When I left I think it's the moment we said, we have to break up with these people... I mean, this is a burden... The only thing it does is not get close to normal people, which is who we want to get close to. ...Because they criticize me a lot and tell me, it's not that you are no longer dedicated to the fight for the Workers, you have betrayed...And the thing is, I don't know, in my neighborhood I live in Legan\u00e9s, in San Nicacio , which is a working-class neighborhood of immigrants... And when I talk to people, whether they are Spanish or from abroad, their problems are that they don't have a job, that their work is rubbish, that they don't make ends meet, that Their daughter can't go out after 9 at night. Because something happens to her, don't let them steal... In other words, they have a series of problems that we, or at least I, share, I live in. that situation too and I want to solve it...And all these Groups, although they are very radical on the Left, are more concerned with invented oppressions, with fashions that come from the United States, and which I do not believe are beneficial for anyone, it is something for the people who move the business...So I kind of, from a very young age I started to break with that...We within what the antifa scene is in its day, or in the more communist vibe, or more extreme left, we were already seen as very bad at that time, because we did not follow these things, we did not like to follow trends...We can be the worst for many people. and we can be criticized for many things, but of course, by being consistent with what we think, it is impossible for us to be criticized because you may like it or not... That is each person's question, but we are not Groucho Marx Marxists, I have some principles and if you don't like them I have others...It is what it is...I mean, we are like that. And if we like it well and if we don't, well, that's just how we are...We don't have to deceive anyone.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:15:55.640000 to 00:16:04.760000 Interviewer says: \"So despite having a very...I mean, extreme leftist approach, one could say, in some aspects, you reject everything that \"Wokeism is really what it is, isn't it? No, no, radically,\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:16:04.760000 to 00:16:44.840000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"No, no, radically, but even on the left that rejects parts of wokeism. And then deep down they play the same game, those people too. ..I mean, I totally deny it... People call it Woke ideology, I call it ideological postmodernism, but it amounts to the same thing... That is, this whole issue of Globalism, which is also called that many times, yes, totally against it...I consider myself a Patriot, I have nothing to do with that...When they say to me, no, it's because you're on the right because you're a patriot, right? Yes, but I defend the class shower Right? So it's like people's heads explode, but following Pacs is the only thing they do without using it... That is, you can have things that are right, but there are things that are wrong and you defend them... \"But it's solely and exclusively because it's your fashion, right? It's like your urban tribe and that's how they work...Yes, in terms of criteria.\"\n\nFrom instant 00:16:44.840000 to 00:16:44.840000 Interviewer says: \"Yes, in criterion.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:16:45.960000 to 00:17:10.080000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Yes, it's a mistake... He criticizes me a lot for sitting down to talk to People who are not of my ideology, supposedly according to them. ..So I have debated with many liberals, I have even debated with real right-wing people, with conservatives, with Woke people too... It's like whoever wants to sit with me to debate and be a person with whom I can speak, I don't have any problem... And that practically makes me, first, a legitimizer of fascism, and then directly a fascist... It's like, well, I don't know, maybe we have different visions. of what a fascist is, let's see Crazy.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:17:12.160000 to 00:17:56.880000 Interviewer says: \"Yes, in the end I understand that you are trying to use common sense... That is, because what I see and what happens to me, that is, having the Another day here in Bascal, it happens to me with people I know who are probably from Vox. And they all defend, for example, the bulls, because they are in the Pack... Because if you buy all the rest of the Things, then also You have to like bulls and that's it... And that's it, and that's what it is... And I say, for me that's what, I don't know, it's a lack of judgment... Just be left, right, up, down...I don't care, right? And then you mentioned the word revolution before...You would say, let's see, in some way it is already a little revolutionized.the environment, the truth...But you would say that a revolution is needed that \"It's happening, it's happening, but badly.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:17:58.680000 to 00:18:54.920000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"I believe that it is not happening and that what is now disguised as the people speaks of Progressivism, of the progressive, of progress... I believe that it is quite the opposite, that society is degenerating at an accelerated pace...People who even know and Hammers, can be seen in the iconography of many Wow and organizations...They talk about socialism, the revolution ...And of course, I think, I also want it to be separated, and that the people who see this separate what I am in itself from the workers' front... Because I do come from a tradition and I do consider myself. communist, but the people of the Workers' Front are not... There are people who are, but many people who are not... It is like a broad front and there is a program that for me is De. that for others is maximum, but that everyone We agree that we have to, what you said about Common Sense, that there are certain things that many people can agree with and we want to be a transversal movement...So I have no problem answering Nada.de Communism or anything, but I want the People to separate me a little from where I come from, from what the front itself is, because if not I can harm them, and that is not my intention... Logical, logical. \"\n\nFrom instant 00:18:54.920000 to 00:18:54.920000 Interviewer says: \"Logical, logical.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:18:56.160000 to 00:19:52.120000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And about what you said, to me these people seem like the Upside Down, the glitter counterrevolution... They seem like the most systemic to me... Because when you say, no, it's because for me they are the most rational... People say, how are these people going to be rational? and it seems to me that the terminology here is important... What they are, they are systemic. ...The left has gone from paralyzing Countries, from wanting to transform, from wanting to reach Socialism, from wanting to do things, to suddenly what they do is Maintain what there is... That is, they make small changes, what they call the Small.advances, but advances for whom, advances of what...So what I see is that it is like a big scam and they are the most systemic, because how are they going to defend the revolution in.the sense of transformation of Society? If they have the same discourse and the same ideological package as Amazon, for example, than Netflix, that is, since when can the subversive radical left have the same line as the large business corporations, you are It breaks your head when you analyze that...And that's what many people don't see, because people are very deceived.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:19:53.200000 to 00:20:41.240000 Interviewer says: \"Of course...Yes, before you mentioned that they are Imported, that they are like imported ideologies...But in the end, I'm breaking down lately. to do this podcast, because since I bring in people who sometimes have their conspiracy approach, the Algorithms contaminate me, I already get conspiracy things, and I'm already a little involved in the game too... So, the other day, no It hasn't come out yet, but we recorded with an expert in masonry, for example, and he talked about how really, it doesn't even have to be from the United States, but from something higher, right? Agenda 2030, everything, that is Well, it sounds conspiratorial too, but when you talk to this guy that the podcast is coming out, you might start to believe it, right? I think he comes from the United States... That's what I was going to ask you... I think that many times conspiracies,\n\nFrom the moment 00:20:38.600000 to 00:20:59.920000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"I think it comes from the United States...I was going to ask you that...I think that many times conspiracies, conspiracy theories, What they do is blur a lot and alienate people a lot... And I think it doesn't help, because people say, no, Agenda 2030 is a Conspiracy theory, you put Agenda 2030 on Google... \"You give it to me and it appears on the web, that is, it is not hidden... It is not a conspiracy, it is something that people do not bother to read... But it is there.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:20:54.520000 to 00:20:54.520000 Interviewer says: \"You give it to me and it appears on the web, that is, it is not hidden.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:21:01.080000 to 00:21:30.360000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And this whole ideological pack that they are imposing on us is something that is coming from the United States...Even the right here is copying the right there, which is the reaction to what is happening there...The whole issue that they talk about Trampismo, of people who are beginning to be fed up with how the United States is evolving...And that they are copying that type of right here... That is, the right that is re-emerging here in Spain. has much more to do with that American style than with the traditional Spanish radical right of farangistas. making squads and going down the street... That does not happen in Spain...The right that exists here is very copied from the one that exists\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:21:30.360000 to 00:21:30.360000 Interviewer says: \"The right that is here is very copied from the one that is\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:21:33.240000 to 00:21:39.280000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"emerging, very copied from the United States...I believe that it copies the United States all the time, which is what we have been doing for decades \"I think it's not very positive for us.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:21:40.920000 to 00:21:45.120000 Interviewer says: \"So, do you think it comes from the United States that simply follows in the footsteps of the United States? Yes, I think that Spain is years behind how \"\n\nFrom the moment 00:21:45.120000 to 00:22:34.920000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Yes, I think that Spain is years behind how it has evolved from the United States... I think this comes from the Anglo-Saxon world... Europe has been imported and Spain is also being imported...And it is a continuous issue...I remember when I started to military this Language.inclusive thing, all this was something that when it arrived I laughed and said, How pathetic, this is never going to be imposed here...Who in their right mind is going to do this? And shortly after, that is, when time passed, they threw me out of the assembly for not accepting it...past 20 years before or 20 years before...And the issue of transgenderism, that movement didn't exist here before...The feminism that was here was different...It's something that constantly comes in waves because...the dominant culture \"here it is the North American one at the level of type of series, of movie, of music, everything comes there... And it is one thing that in the end people fall for... Social networks, everything comes there.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:22:37.840000 to 00:22:41.520000 Interviewer says: \"Yes, it has a lot of influence on what the lifestyle is...Of course, and at the level of ideology on the population and of\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:22:41.520000 to 00:22:55.440000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Of course, and at the level of ideology about the population and culture, it is the culture that pushes national cultures...And the \"nationals and the whole world is taking this very cosmopolitan, globalist culture...And what is done is erasing it from here instead of continuing to evolve and adapt things that are not from here.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:22:53.080000 to 00:23:02.320000 Interviewer says: \"And what is done is to delete it from here instead of continuing. And do you think it comes from the governments, from the Companies? Yes \"I think it's a conjunction.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:23:03.920000 to 00:23:55.160000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Because I believe that governments are at the service of those who finance them...So who finances the governments? Well, those big companies... Who do they depend on at the level of image and other issues as well? So, I think that both the left, Well, the more Psoe-style left, more of the big parties, that is, as Margallo said, centrists, both the Psoe and the PP defend similar things...In fact, Margallo says that the 2030 agenda is the gospel...And keep in mind that it is the party that came from the dictatorship, which was very conservative people...And now Look, what positions they are having... And that is because they are adapting party speeches. North American catch-all... Even the parties here were not like that... The Socialist Party in Spain was a grassroots party, a party who came from workerism, from the union... He wants to get votes from whoever... He is not focused on a segment, on the population, and he defends his interests... It is like he is focused on what is good.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:23:55.160000 to 00:23:55.160000 Interviewer says: \"It's like it's focused on what feels good.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:23:57.240000 to 00:24:04.960000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And the PP is exactly the same...They have become catch-all parties...And that is also imported. Why? Because the Party Republican and the Democratic Party are like that too...We copy the United States a lot.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:24:06.760000 to 00:24:14.080000 Interviewer says: \"I guess they also force each other to be able to compete...If you are going to catch it all, I also have to go catch it all to be able to compete with you...And in the European Union, the same thing, everything has been imposed a lot\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:24:14.080000 to 00:24:33.160000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And in the European Union, likewise, everything North American has been imposed a lot... Even the migratory models that exist are with a perception that It's similar...The anti-racism spokespersons of the Big Organizations, etc., are literally copied from How.they are in the United States...And it is something that is very global...They approach it in a way quite global.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:24:36.560000 to 00:24:47.080000 Interviewer says: \"And pulling the wire, because we follow either governments, corporations, it catches my attention, what could be the interest behind all this wow? Get to what point? Who is interested in what?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:24:47.080000 to 00:27:09.560000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Who is interested in what? Well, I believe that on an economic level they have a lot of profit...They have a great Montado business, in which What they say is acceptable and they induce a type of consumption...And what they do is implement it...And it is money and money and money...And in fact, now there is beginning to be a reaction.. Even companies that have dedicated themselves to being pure business in this sense, for example, Disney, Netflix, etc., people are starting to get fed up... There is a reaction, their sales are even going down... Now they are going to open an interesting period...But so far what there has been is an incredible business...Because even with the issue of transgenderism and an incredible Business behind it...And what they do is make money, political profit and capacity to maintain their control...And on top of that with a cloak of progress, it's not that fascists come from I don't know who to complain...And I have seen it with the riots in France...I have seen how organizations here in Spain, super revolutionaries, some who are in mayor's offices, saying that well, that we must support the riots and that it is a question of, come on, practically the revolution in . France...And there were people burning centers for immigrants, churches, libraries, attacking people because of their skin color. On the street... It's like it's a dystopia... I mean, what has happened in France is that entire areas have been lumpenized...There are people who live on the margins separated from society and what the migratory model does is encourage this to happen more and more...And there are millions of people who do not feel of that country and that, in addition, they are like the fashion of the suburbs that, as soon as anything happens, they go out into the street... That is, a boy dies in that accident... Because the guy didn't shoot him the head, as they say...Die, okay...A shame, about him being a criminal, etc., it doesn't matter...Die, I don't think he had to die...But hey, I don't think he would either. What he did is not right either...But the thing is, this boy dies, France burns...A Syrian refugee who was an Islamist, they said no he was a Christian, in the end he was an Islamist, he dedicated himself to stabbing babies in a park ...Which is very good, Luis...Yes, but did France take to the streets? It didn't come out, nothing happened...I think that's when France has to burn and say that there has to be a change...But nothing happens there...A common criminal dies and everything burns... It can't be, it can't be... In other words, the implementation of these measures at all levels, both migratory and non-migratory, has led to dystopian situations... Feminism has gone beyond the movement \"feminist. She was betting on separating herself from men, on enhancing women, a series of issues that don't seem right to me either.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:26:59.520000 to 00:26:59.520000 Interviewer says: \"Feminism has gone too far, the feminist movement was betting\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:27:10.640000 to 00:31:18.560000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Because I believe in equality, but in real equality...Quotas, discrimination, etc....But the thing is, it is It has gone from that to the fact that now those who rule, in many cases, are people who say they are women and who have displaced what could be called biological women... And not only that, but they call them Terf, that is , because the Nazis, and they are going to beat them in the places... The other day, at CNT, which is a union not at all suspected of being right-wing, in anything like that, they held a rally and tried to beat them for doing .an act in defense, that is, against the erasure of women, which is what is happening... We live in a dystopian situation in all areas, migratory model, the issue of Women, the education of children and persexualizing them and putting horrific theories, from my point of view, into their heads... Promoting individualism, but at a level that is destroying people, when there are more mental problems than ever, when there are supposed to be There are more media and more professionals than ever, weakness is being encouraged in our society... People are getting weaker... And there are people who say, no, it's just that, of course, like the White man. Now is weak, well, of course, these things happen because... And it's like, weakness is not being encouraged in everyone... I mean, it doesn't matter what color you have, weakness is being encouraged... There is people who are ashamed of being Spanish, there are people who are ashamed of being white, there are people who are ashamed of being otorosexual... There comes a time when it is ridiculous and you see things that are truly dystopian... I'm going to say Something that may be outrageous, they did a nudist march and naked guys came out dancing... And I looked at the side and there were small children... It's not normal, it's not normal... I mean, they can do whatever they want, but why do there have to be some children there? Why do they have to do it in the street? Why do we have a Pride month? Well, I tell you, why do we have a Pride month? because it is a great business...They did it one day and said, this is a business, we do it for a month...Do they really care about people's sexual orientations? No, because in Spain the vast majority of people do not care what sexual orientation you have... That is your thing in your life and you will do what you want... Nobody gets in there... When People talk about Spain, it's not that Spain is Horrible, it is a homophobic, racist country... If that happened, there wouldn't be 8 million immigrants in Spain... If that happened, there wouldn't be a pride month... It's unreal...If you tell me, no, we are going to talk about Hungary, well we can sit down and talk about Hungary, but in Spain, which is a country that opens its doors to the whole world. and that is a very open country in general, we do not live in the 50s with Franco... That is, this has evolved... There are people who are still with Franco as if he were alive. and they are like in a kind of civil war between Left and Right. of ideological groups... And it is ridiculous because even at that time in the 30s, you read, for example, the clandestine publication of the Falange. when they were illegalized and the reports came out about when they killed each other. and they spoke with respect from the people... That is, you read the memoirs of some Falangists or texts. and those of the communists who were in the Shock brigades, that is, to kill themselves with them who literally killed themselves. before the war civil, that is, during the republic, and they were people who later respected each other... And when they wrote 20 or 30 years later about that Moment, they literally killed each other for their ideas and still respected each other... You see now, It's like a chicken coop, they're there with each other, chattering, then they appear in photos laughing and drinking I don't know what... I mean, it's like there's an enmity and they create an enmity in the population. It's like living in a civil war, but it does not exist... It is not that it is a war between the communists, who are the social communists, . Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Podemos, which makes me laugh, and the fascists who are all the rest... And there are neither fascists nor communists there, it's like a scam, they are making fun of people... And I every Every time I say this, people's heads explode and I'm afraid of everything, but it's the truth... And when I see photos of Spinoza a los Monteros with Pablo Iglesias in Parliament at the time, laughing, making jokes, I say, then why do you have that Polarization when you speak? If it is unreal, it is a lie, it is like facing the gallery... And people stop talking, they block each other, they run campaigns at a social level... And then the politicians who represent them get along well with each other...And this is like the party...And you see how it was in the parliamentary sessions of La Rep\u00fablica, for example, and they were people who literally wanted to kill themselves...But then they didn't They saw them together... That guy, uh, crashes, we're going to party later... It didn't happen... Then they're laughing at people... And it's something that pisses me off to no end.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:31:21 to 00:31:46.920000 Interviewer says: \"Yes, I suppose it is like a play and that for Them the situation is much easier to handle when the population is Arguing and is distracted between them, right? I mean, fighting continuously...And also linking a little with what you said before...What I feel is that today having something to offend you for has become a a privilege...And if you don't have anything that offends you, you need, that is, I need a little flag to carry, something to defend my Message, my role on Twitter, I have something, I have to complain about something, right?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:31:51.480000 to 00:33:07.120000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Look, they once tried to create a coordinator against oppression in Valencia, okay? And in the end, of course, they have to make it like a stopover for the members and so on...And it was so crazy and like everyone had to oppress each other that they dissolved...Because, of course, it was who oppresses who more? It was like a game, like a role-playing game interpreting something...So , it's not serious, it's not serious... I tell you, I, for example, when he says, it's not that... When people say, no, there is a problem, for example, because also the people on the street street speaks in a different way, it is not correct...And you ask, what are the problems in your neighborhood or someone? and now immigration is going to tell you, I don't know what, it is going to tell you in a very direct way. ..And, of course, and he says, no, but you are an oppressor... And he is a guy who works from morning to afternoon, he goes to pick up his daughter home, he has to accompany her so that nothing happens to him, he takes care of his family, earns money to support them... That is, he is a person who is a good person, so to speak... Why is he an oppressor of anything? Because? Because he is white and lives in a neighborhood where they are robbing him, where they are making his life impossible and he is a hard worker...And a person who is a yuppie university student, who has never hit a brick in his life because he is living off his parents...And that person who is deconstructed and says, oh, I'm very oppressed, that person is revolutionary, when in reality he is a parasite. And you can call those things...And that's how we see it with politicians that there are today...I mean, there are politicians from your sea who come from being spokespersons for, who are going to talk about nothing if they are privileged people.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:33:10.600000 to 00:33:55.440000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Now we come to talk about the issue of the Sahara, for example...I know daughters of Polisario leaders, that is, not exactly the most neglected people ,who have come here with distinguished families because they are the children of... and now they are spokespersons who are dedicated to saying no, it is that I as an oppressed person and it is like look, you have an apartment in Moncloa, you are a person who lives of luxury, you are a person with higher education and you have not had a problem in your entire life... You can't say, no, it's just that we racialized people don't, you don't... There are people who do, for example, people Moroccan from my neighborhood can say it, but you can't say it and you live from that, you live from that... There are people who live from being of Her origin, but you have to look at their material living conditions, because Maybe their material living conditions are better than ours...I don't own a house, I haven't had that opportunity yet.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:33:10.600000 to 00:33:10.600000 Interviewer says: \"Now we come to talk about the issue of the Sahara, for example.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:33:59.680000 to 00:33:59.680000 Interviewer says: \"and I don't play the martyr for it, but there are people who live by playing the martyr.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:34:03.320000 until 00:34:46.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"It's what you say, that if there is no flag he takes another, he doesn't care...And he follows a speech that everyone says himself ,which is repulsive...I see it, for example, that people will insult me \u200b\u200ba lot later, with the issue of the spokespersons of the environmentalist thing...I defend the sustainability of the planet, I believe in Ecology, but I don't in environmentalism this...I mean, this is ridiculous, it's making people laugh...I mean, because a person uses plastic cups or not, it's not going to solve any problem...The problem is going to be that production is stopped and an alternative is given...And what they do is make people laugh...Well, the Greta Thunbergs on duty are all like Prefabricated, they dress the same, they speak the same, they make the same gestures...I I see the same thing with Femenlo... I mean, I saw a talk they gave that was... you have to make an angry face, do like this... It's like a lobotomization course, to make everyone the same.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:34:50.880000 to 00:35:08.920000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"So it is a fashion, it is a fashion and it is very clear... They don't care about sustainability, because sustainability is global... If Spain stops producing one thing and Coca Cola is produced here, for example, the same company stops producing one thing and three times as much is produced in China, there is no sustainability whatsoever... In other words, the problem is going to get worse. ...And so it is with all these ridiculous fashions.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:34:50.880000 to 00:34:50.880000 Interviewer says: \"Then it is a fashion, it is a fashion and it is very clear.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:35:11.560000 until 00:35:55 \u200b\u200bInterviewer says: \"Yes, just like that. And what bothers me is When, apart from following the same pattern and the same clothing that I say, for Please, we are gestures... Yes, everything. But now... What bothers me the most is all the noise they try to make... I mean, you are vegan. Okay... Why do you put it? in the biography of all your social networks? It appeals to me that you are vegan. I mean, why? Why not? But hey, getting away from that topic a little, something that I really liked about your speech is the defense of flag, damn it, because for me this is pure common sense. Okay? I mean, the fact that you have, let's say, associated with the Ultra Right, practically the fact that you have a flag of Spain, which is your country... But all the symbols, not just the flag, all, absolutely everything.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:35:55 \u200b\u200bto 00:37:26.240000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"But all the symbols, not just the flag, all of them, absolutely everything... Even the name. In other words, the more country people are called the more country...What country is that? The truth is that they don't say it, they are ashamed...They do an act, Rajon once did an act and a guy told him to boycott...He told him long live Spain and Viva said, but he spent half an hour justifying it... They were very unfortunate for me because he said viva... In a meeting, they have done it to me before, they say viva Espa\u00f1a to me and I say viva... And I continue, because not I have to be ashamed... It's just that I am from here or with history or with things... I don't know, I am a historian and I am also. The periods that I like the most are mine, which is contemporary, which is a republic, etc., that period... And then I like the era of the thirds... I give lectures about it, I write about it too and people call me a fascist... And it's as if fascism did not exist At that time...I mean, in the time of the Thirds, fascism did not exist, it does not make any sense...I mean, it is not just the flag or not the flag, everything is criminalized...To our actions We use the republican one too, because it is a flag of Spain... But, for example, when people come with the normal redness, then they come... because people feel Spanish, they have grown up here... That's the flag he was raised with...And what are you going to do? Well, that's it, nothing happens... You accept it and that's it... And that's what everyone should do, because it makes no sense to attack your own country... It's like people play national team and you see a Lots of Spaniards like let's go...France. And it's how you go with France... I mean, it's already reached a point where it seems like a meme... I mean, they hate their team, they hate their country, they hate their history, they hate their traditions, they hate their culture...And I think that comes a lot from the United States.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:37:29.240000 to 00:38:35.320000 Interviewer says: \"Yes, I think they continue, in the end they continue...The play we were talking about before they follow blindfolded, literally ...And they are and are so easy to fool...The other day I was here...I think you did something with him on your Bertrand de Vox channel, for example...And I was talking to him, something I say is that he is totally true To say, well, for example, \u00ed\u00f1igo de rej\u00f3n, you see it, the clothes they wear, it's not a bit like everything has been studied... I see you eating in the arde that is in the retreat, which I don't know They give 100,200 bucks, I don't know, I've never eaten there, but I say come on... And then the only thing missing is a hole here in your T-shirt, and the clothes, all the non-verbal language... And in the end with I think that ends up being enough to deceive a large part of the population... So I suppose that with your message when addressing the population, you appeal to common sense, to situations... common sense, I have already been proud of the positive things, of who we are.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:38:35.320000 to 00:41:56.880000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"With common sense I have already been proud of the positive things, of what we are...I think it is something that unites many people. ..And yet, they criticize me a lot, for example, because of my manners... Because I am a very good guy, which, for example, feminist people would call toxic masculinity, a big guy who If he has to say things, he says them with strong, serious gestures... That is, I am a person who does not fit in a little with how they do politics... People tell me that you should be a different way... .And I say, I don't play a role... People tell me, no, but professional politicians, I don't want to be a professional politician... I don't play a role. I do, like that... You You see them and they are all cut a little from the same pattern of a typical spokesperson. And we don't like that...And when I appeal, especially with the front, we focus on several things...A When the meetings tell me, no, but what about your specific measure about I don't know what? And it's like, look, most politicians talk about measures that they will never apply. We are going to focus on five very clear things...One is revolutionary patriotism. The second is to defend that fight...when there are problems and they support labor reforms, that even the liberals agree with her. so that they can see the class character that it has...This reform has to go to France, take photos because they are going to raise the retirement age, and we have to have strikes, and then here in Spain they raise it and do nothing...They are subsidized unions, for me state-run, and they have absolutely no struggle...We want rebuild a unionism that does defend the interests of the Workers, and that is not like the union programs that talk about environmentalism, Feminism, deconstruction, workshops of I don't know what, which we don't care about... These are not problems that affect the workers, that is why the unions have fewer and fewer members... what we have said about the left and the right, that we think that the regime itself has no possible salvation, the one here, because in general the problems we have. and we need something new, a constituent process to do something new. and that we are not living with the Constitution that our parents' generation approved or more... And then, finally, a bitter fight against Guoqism, against globalism, as you want to call it, because we consider that they must be kicked out of Spaces, which they themselves are already beginning to abandon. and that in countries like France or Germany, where the Communist Party won before, they will suffer or alternative for Germany...And that is a symptom that they have abandoned any reference or any proposal for resolution of the problems that affect workers...And we are going to focus on those five things...We do not have a program on the Internet, we have a summarized program as well, but that is what we are going to focus on...I am not saying, I am not talking about measures that yes, someday we will do...No, no, I am talking about what We're going to do it now...I mean, next week we're doing this now...Mohamed Vi, I don't know if you've seen it. No...Well, we dropped a banner and it came out denouncing what Morocco is doing in Spain. And they came out kissing Mohamed Vi and Pedro S\u00e1nchez...they have denounced us, they have attacked the banner...The threats and so on from of .\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:41:56.880000 until 00:41:56.880000 Interviewer says: \"The threats and others on the part of .\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:42:01.080000 to 00:42:04.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"But individuals...No, no, in front. Yes, yes, individuals...I was showing in Topic in Algeria, of course, because the Algerians have taken the opportunity to laugh.\"\n\nFrom instant 00:42:01.080000 to 00:42:01.080000 Interviewer says: \"But individual.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:42:09.320000 to 00:42:39.720000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And nothing, they try to attack us in places...What happens is that we are not very impressionable, because as we already have, the Turks also in that sense is giving more taking, because it doesn't matter to us a little...But it is simply to set an example so that people see that it is not the same...I mean, right now I can go out here and they can make me I don't know what, but I don't care... We are people, we are tough people and we promote people to be like that... and to say that you have anxiety... When you have it, I think you have to fistfight, get out of the problem, and then the rest will be solved.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:42:44.120000 to 00:42:52.600000 Interviewer says: \"How do you see the society that is undoubtedly weakening in the future? In other words, do you think that difficult times are coming and that it is going to be difficult for them to navigate? those those seas?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:42:54.400000 to 00:43:20.960000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"I think that very, very complicated times are coming and I think it will be very related to what is happening in France...And I think that The people here, in Spain, are not prepared right now, at any level, to face what is going to happen... In fact, in the places it is a different problem, for example, with the gangs... But in El Salvador Bukele, for example, has shown that if war is really declared on certain issues, it can be solved... But it has been a country at war to be able to achieve it.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:43:24.160000 until 00:43:24.160000 Interviewer says: \"And times like this are coming, very complicated times are coming\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:43:26.880000 to 00:47:40.480000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"and there are going to be two options...One, to dissolve and be something new. And we are preparing for that Option, because I believe that That's what's going to happen...In fact, in France I think it's going to happen sooner than here...And I think people say no, but that's the end...I think not, because I believe I try to look for the origin of the Phrase, but I can't find it, that many people say it, that difficult times make hard men... Yes, the cycle... Yes, yes. And I think it's going to be like this...I believe that we are going to a very complicated situation, that this situation comes in all things due to the weakness that has been fostered, because I believe that in other times this would not have been allowed...There are certain things that I believe that would not have been allowed...People would have gone out into the streets and would not have been allowed...and face this...And we are working to create people like that...We, when the kids approach We, for example, have a very great youth aggression...It is the strongest thing we have, that is a symptom of the future...When people come, we encourage people to train, for people to study, because many people come sometimes from certain neighborhoods or from problems that people do not want to study or do anything... And we tell people that they have to be productive. If they have abilities, they can contribute a lot to the collective... If a person He doesn't know how to do anything, he can't contribute anything... You can be a lot of people, but in reality you are worth nothing... So you first have to build yourself and then contribute to others, because if not you are like something parasitic of the group...And I think it is a wrong way of seeing the community, especially organizations...What needs to be done is to train people, that people have critical capacity, that people are intelligent ,that people are trained...they know a lot about the manuals that repeat things, but they are not critical, because they do not want anyone to be critical of what they do...But for us it is the other way around... And people can turn out badly, Obviously, but for each one that turns out well like this, 20 more could turn out, if they want, I wouldn't care... It would be a success, which is not the case, but it would be a success... And I, there are many kids who have joined our things, they have already entered because they came from being homeless, from being alcoholics, very young people... And they have ended up, over the years, getting degrees, getting modules, training, competing in boxing things, things like that, in weightlifting... In other words, we encourage people to develop and that people have the capabilities to be able to contribute to the collective... Because if not, we would be Like many organizations that exist, they have very weak, very fragile people, who are not prepared for any complications... You keep in mind, I go to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bfor example, and a mob of people comes to shout at me, to try to hit us...We're going to Seville or wherever...People come with helmets, with sticks to hit us. That happens...There is a position of ours and it comes to bursting our position...That happens to us constantly...So what happens? That we need people who can face that... Not only to face it physically, but to face it psychologically, that it is a pressure... So, we go with our own order service, we have super prepared people. Because? Because we have forged ourselves in the difficulty that before things happened to us, and now we do not allow them to happen... And I think it is a very appropriate mentality when creating an organizational structure that can serve something in the future. And I think it's a question of values...I try, above all, to me people tell me, no, you're very medieval, but there are things like having Honor, having a word. They are things that say, no, that has nothing to do with it... Well, I think so... Because a person without words, what differentiates us from an animal? I'm really telling you... I mean, I try to encourage people with that type of things... Companionship, that is, certain things that in Society are very devalued and that I believe don't have to be like this...For example, in many left-wing groups, not being competitive is encouraged, right? You are not competitive, competitive in the sense that it affects you, of becoming a monster for yourself, no, but... Being hungry... In the sense, yes, of wanting to improve yourself, of wanting to have goals, of ...If you don't have that, you're not going to move forward...There are people who tell me, no, because you have a very entrepreneurial mentality...And it's true...But because a person, regardless of the Society, of the conditions, has to try to make himself... Because if not, in reality you are not going to be well. Never, because you are not going towards what you want... And that is that \"It's for politics and for everything.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:47:43.200000 to 00:47:45.200000 Interviewer says: \"It's super paradoxical to talk to you, really...I know this doesn't make much sense, but it's what I really think.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:47:45.200000 to 00:47:45.200000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"I know this doesn't make much sense, but it's what I really think.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:47:48.160000 to 00:48:24.480000 Interviewer says: \"But and I had not heard this part of your message in Concrete, but I really congratulate you because it seems to me... I mean, it seems to me that it is something so simple, so basic, but at the same time so important and so fundamental for a person, the fact of being useful, of having your own criteria, of being a little critical, of taking care of what you put in your body, what you do with him, how you develop it... They are all the bases, really... I see many people who look for the magic formula and I say, hey, they are the four pillars that what you have said, the preparation that you try to give them to young people, I understand, above all... When I talk about militant culture, \"\n\nFrom the moment 00:48:24.480000 to 00:49:06.400000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"When I talk about militant culture, that at the level of culture of how any person should be. From my point of view, I talk about denial , of sacrifice, of discipline, of study, of training... In other words, they are things that strengthen you... I give you the example of prison... I, for example, come out a new man ...Why? Because I trained every day, two hours... And the rest I dedicated myself to reading and doing things, and thinking and reflecting... Stopping to reflect, that is, putting everything aside, which only now Also, I leave my cell phone, I leave things, and I start to think... I start to think about what I'm going to do, what I want, what my goals are... I start to think... People don't do that They don't stop to think... They're like on Tiktok almost all day, a video, video, video, video, and you cover up and say, what's the first video you've seen? He doesn't even know, he's just consuming and he is totally addicted...It's okay to use networks, it's okay to use technologies, it's okay to use everything, but let it be an instrument for you to grow, no.\"\n\nFrom instant 00:49:03.800000 to 00:49:03.800000 Interviewer says: \"It's okay to use networks, it's okay to use technologies,\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:49:10.520000 to 00:50:18.960000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Not something that destroys you, that you have a sick dependency... And that happens with alcohol, with... I don't drink alcohol, for example...And there are people who seem fine to me, that if they want to drink, they can do whatever they want, but I, for example, don't...But I am against people being Addicted, against people are alcoholics, that people have a dependency and that their lives are destroyed... At the level of youth, especially that the leisure that exists now is so like that, we encourage people not to do those things... And people tell us, no, that's fascist and I... It's not true... It's just that the things I'm talking about are about honor, about personal matters, right? Because, of course, people say, no. , it is that you with the Order thing, and that is what you have become, but the thing is that a person who does not have Order in his life and who functions in an anarchic and Destructive way, is not going to be able to contribute to anyone... Because if you You are destroyed inside, how are you going to contribute to Nobody? not to family, not to friend, not to girlfriend, not to children, not to anything... You cannot contribute... You have to make people healthy... I believe that what society encourages right now is not That's it, it's quite the opposite...And this is not about ideologies...I mean, this is, for me, having half a brain...I mean, people can later criticize me for my ideology, for whatever I want...But what I'm saying, well, you may like it or not, but it's something that many people who don't have an ideology tell me, damn it, well, what you're saying, well, I like it... .Totally...And it has nothing to do with ideology...It's like a way of understanding personal development.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:50:16.720000 to 00:50:33.640000 Interviewer says: \"Totally...And it has nothing to do with ideology...Well, look, let's see, I consider myself an entrepreneur by nature.and The truth is that the message is very linked...I would like to know at what point you break with the figure of an entrepreneur, for example, or a businessman, therefore.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:50:35.360000 to 00:51:09.760000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Man, well, I believe that in my specific case, from the class perspective, in the order of ideal society that would be for Me, that is, I think that's where it really breaks... Because I, for example, am very entrepreneurial, but I, the entrepreneur that I am, apart from my personal development of survival, etc., is also to contribute to the collective... And I believe that people who are very entrepreneurial and very good at Entrepreneurship focus more on themselves and on making money and on rising... And that is their goal... And I think I have a different goal and I eat more. of society...And I think that is where we differ...But you prioritize, let's say, the community before the individual.\"\n\nFrom time 00:51:14.320000 to 00:51:14.320000 Interviewer says: \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:51:14.320000 until 00:51:14.320000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nFrom instant 00:51:15.680000 to 00:51:15.680000 Interviewer says: \"I think that's the point.\"\n\nFrom instant 00:51:19.360000 to 00:51:19.360000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Of course.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:51:20.840000 to 00:52:00.880000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"But I think that for the collective you also have to be an entrepreneur in the sense of building. There are many people who like to get a job, for For example, they stay there and that's it... And I think it's a mentality that they also get in them that, Damn, you also have to know how to move and know how to progress in order to... I, for example, want to have children... I have a girlfriend and I want to have children...Of course, I have to build something there to be able to have it...I can't dedicate myself to having a dependency and waiting, to see if I'm lucky and it goes well...And no, no I have a personal goal...I will have to achieve it...I then ask other questions that we do differ on that...But in the construction of my family, for example, I also have to look for the good of my family...But my family is not something individual...There are also many people who think, no, that is individual.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:51:20.840000 to 00:51:20.840000 Interviewer says: \"But I think that for the collective you also have to be an entrepreneur in the sense of\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:51:59.560000 to 00:51:59.560000 Interviewer says: \"But my family is not something individual.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:52:04.360000 to 00:52:12.360000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"If it is a family, it is not individual... It is a small community, but it is not something individual... And there are people who He also calls it reactionary because of this, but because it is even frowned upon to have children.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:52:14.840000 to 00:52:42.360000 Interviewer says: \"And a question, you, you, that is, from your situation, let's say that you are a person who perhaps prioritizes the Collective. in a society or in an environment where each person prioritizes their individual situation, their family, etc....Also, therefore, you begin to prioritize your individual situation...I mean, I suppose that if you can.buy, I don't know, if you had the option to save and Buy.properties to have them as assets, for Your...For example, me, being like this, that is, me, because of how I am, \"\n\nFrom the moment 00:52:42.360000 to 00:54:51.040000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"For example, being like this, that is, I, because of who I am, could have prospered much more economically if I focused on myself, which Yes, I will focus on what I am doing...But I, for example, will not, obviously, for my own and ideological reasons, I will not dedicate myself to speculating or doing any type of those things...But I am a person who He writes, I sell my books, I produce things... I'm a guy who has value in what he does... Of course, there are a lot of people who criticize me. No, it's just that you're like I don't know what... No, it's The problem is that you don't produce any value when you do things. Or you don't do anything and I'm a person that what I do generates value... I'm a person whose head explodes... But that's what makes you I say, people must be trained...If people had it, I believe that injustice is there because it is not encouraged, that people are trained and that there are people in certain environments who do not have the opportunity or They have it too difficult...And I believe that what needs to be done is to encourage people to have capabilities...But the thing is that teaching right now, and I'm telling you, I'm in a doctoral program, it's just that It doesn't encourage that, it doesn't encourage that... In fact, the majority of people, for example, in my career want to be a professor and want to be a civil servant... But the thing is that wanting to be a civil servant and that's it, I think it's like a Mentality, how it is focused right now, which is not very productive... Because what we do, we have a state that is ultra bureaucratized, what is there, I don't know, when I see the things of the administration, above all it works. terrible way and I think it could be optimized even with fewer people and encourage work in another way, even from the state... And I think what is done is create dependencies because that is how clientele networks and it depends on who Well, I think they get votes, they get influence and they do certain things... Because of course, the Pac thing too, I mean, I in my ideal society, obviously, not even in the ideal one, I, for example I would socialize or nationalize the statistical sectors so that people understand me... I have things that I would make radical changes, but the thing is, it is not that more state and more bureaucracy is better, because it depends on who dominates. the state, it depends on what for, it depends on whether it is effective... It's just that thinking that everything that has to do with state intervention has to be something, that has losses, that is super bureaucratic, that is like a herial ...I think it is a mistake, that there have been historical examples that have gone wrong...I think that this mentality is already like a failure, it is already admitted that that does not work and I think that that is a mistake \"\n\nFrom the moment 00:54:53.560000 to 00:55:07.040000 Interviewer says: \"But, for example, in the current situation in Spain, that is, I can still see your final photo, ideal, but the transition, how does it Can you imagine? Because, I mean, today it is a reality that the only profitable company is the public lottery, right? In the current situation, and I tell you this with the points that I said before of\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:55:07.040000 to 00:55:56.440000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"In the current situation, and I tell you with the points that I said before about focusing, I believe that now what matters is the recovery of national sovereignty, because any measure we want to take, for example, with immigration, borders, etc., without national sovereignty we cannot change it, nor develop the industry, nor re-technize the countryside and let that begin. to work...And people say, anyone would say that measure, not a revolutionary...Well, okay, congratulations, but I think it's what is needed...And I think that then there is a deficit when it comes to Even from a point of view of democracy, of democracy, I believe that there is a deficit in the way things are, that people do not really participate in things and then, furthermore, important things are not voted on... People are always talking about referendums, but there has not been a referendum on the immigration model, there has not been a referendum to destroy our industry, there has not been a referendum to leave lands without production in Andalusia and \"We bought it from Morocco, or the relations with Morocco, that has not been voted on anywhere.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:55:59.080000 to 00:58:20.120000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"So I believe that that is why there has to be a constituent change, so that there is a new Constitution that really solves certain problems...For example The issue of the independentistas...Here in Spain is that the electoral laws favor this being so...I understand when they did it, that is, when they did it it was so that the Communist Party would be annulled... Why? Because it could be a danger in the year 75, 76, well, in the years later, in 75, no, later... Okay, but that is no longer a danger... Now, people that gets fewer votes than Pacma, they are deciding or they can even have the key to the government, that cannot be, that is, it cannot be... So it is something that no longer provides a solution to the problems that exist. ...That's why I often criticize Vox and Podemos that yes, they are coming to change I don't know what, but they are in all the autonomous governments that they can... Well, now it's going to be their sea and then they won't, I don't see them saying, no, it's just that we have to remove the Constitution and we have to have a process in which everyone participates in something new... I don't see them doing that. On the contrary, Podemos produced a document that was like their program with the Constitution... Okay, Vox with the issue of the monarchy and all this... we have overtaken them on all sides... And I think that in that sense there you see, there you see that although both want to make small changes, both, that is, both parties, even if they are in opposite directions, I see that deep down it is like the parties are a crutch for the big ones... .And I speak this a lot, I am going to say one thing, that the same people go crazy, but I, for example, speak to people who are deputies of Podemos. or who have been deputies, because I know them from when I was a kid and we were all in the communist youth... So yes, there are a lot of people who hate me, whatever you want, but you have known a guy for 25 years, 20, . And I have and with people from Vox too... And I tell them... And the answer is already, but that way at least we do something... And then there are many people who tell me, I don't know, to I would like what you say about the Pac. No, I would like to... I know people in Vox who are very anti-bullfighting... they think that the measures that we say are much more precise. and that we address the issue in a more general way as well... To me there are people who are now at sea, but people who have been deputies from here, from Madrid, from the community... And to me with things we do, for example, the workers' struggle of the unions. and things we do, What he tells me, Damn, is that you are very right about this, but they will never say it, because they take away from them, they take away from them.\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:55:59.080000 to 00:55:59.080000 Interviewer says: \"So I think that's why there has to be a constituent change, that\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:58:20.120000 to 00:58:23.360000 Interviewer says: \"but they will never say it, because they take away, they take away... But now that you mentioned it, at the immigration level, what is the proposal?\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:58:29.440000 to 00:58:29.440000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"In fact, I have a book that I don't know about, I bring it to you,\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:58:29.440000 to 00:58:29.440000 Interviewer says: \"In fact, I have a book that I don't know about, I bring it to you,\"\n\nFrom the moment 00:58:31.720000 to 01:05:42.040000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"but hey, one day when I pass by your court I will bring it to you if you want... First of all, there is a question of conception... That is to say, the problem is not immigration itself nor the immigrant itself, which I believe is a mistake to criminalize the person. And it is a mistake to think that immigration can be eradicated in a magical way... Immigration has been Before, there has been immigration now, there will be immigration in the future. The issue is massiveness... That is the problem we have here... And people say, no, but when is it decided when there are more people? .which the country can receive? Well, I believe that there are some very clear symptoms...The first is that unemployment is no longer just national, but that the immigrant population has significant unemployment...The youth unemployment that exists in the country, which is around 30%, I think it also shows that there are very precarious jobs, that there are people who are not willing to take them...Why? Because they are conditions that only Someone who will not accept will accept them. have absolutely nothing...Recently there was a case in which there were some job offers in Andalusia that said they had no manpower...And one of those guys who wrote to me told me, and I have to to move from the city because I live in a house...He says, it costs me more to go there than what they pay me...Why? Because it is a job offer that is designed to go from the shanty town next door to the place and people who have nothing... Then the jobs are impoverished... Being a waiter, when I was a child, was a job...There were people who were 60 years old, 60-something, and they retired as a waiter and it was a good job...Nowadays, who works as a waiter? When I walk around the places, they are mostly young immigrant people... Why? Because they are the ones who are going to accept that now...Those people, as they progress, are going to take other types of jobs...What's happening? They need more new people...So they bring them. There are people who are improving, obviously, because they make an effort, because there are people who make an effort, there are people who don't... But it is a continuum, it is a continuum... So, it can't be that last year, in the holy migratory more than half a million people came...Why? Because if you do this in 10,15,20 years, what do we have left in the end? There is no longer Spain, it is something else... So, a country has the capacity to assimilate people. And in Spain it is overwhelmed... That is, at the same time that there is unemployment among the immigrant population. And they begin to to gather together in ghettos separated from society, as happens, well, here in Spain it already happens, but in Germany and other places they even impose laws, such as Islamic law, even with Islamic police, which is like co-official, in the sense that it is allowed for internal affairs...That is a dystopia. That happens in France and Germany...So, that's a problem. That is a very serious problem...Why? Because there is beginning to be an alternative reaction for Germany, and it is about to be the first force in the polls... Why? Because people are fed up with this...And the left says nothing is happening...The issue of the south, the southern border in reality, that is, there are many people who do a lot of demagoguery, there are parties that do a lot of demagoguery with this ...The problem is not in the number of people who sneak through the strait, because there are tens of thousands compared to the half a million that I just told you arrived last year...In numbers, much fewer people. ..Even illegal immigration on a massive scale comes by plane...That should also be controlled. The problem in the south is security... You don't know who is coming... but maybe it's a rapist and he comes here, who tears up the papers, he arrives here, I'm nobody, and then here he dedicates himself to doing his things. things...People who are thieves, people who are Islamists, people who we don't know who is coming, because there is no control...And that is a problem. The people who come by plane do know who they are... But the people who come on that boat will be people who come to work, and that is very good, but I don't think it's good that they come like that... I think they should deport them, because everyone can come here, then the country has no meaning... A country that does not control its borders is dissolved... I believe that the border must be controlled, that this can be done with police and with Endowment, and we must put an end to the call effect...How do you do that? Well, like in Australia... What Australia did was set up a port, they take the immigrants down, they take them to the Safe Port, from there they send them directly to their country, that is, the success rate now of getting there is zero, They put the gangsters in jail and their boats are sunk...What's happening? That in the first years there were many interventions, but a mafia is a company, it's like a company, they don't get tired, they don't make money, so if they don't make money, then they start doing something else. Of course...There are no dead people in the sea and in the Mediterranean they don't stop dying, which is human. End the mafia and put an end to that. Or the NGO's discourse is no, it's that everyone has a place here. And let them continue dying at sea. I believe that the thing about Australia, and that is what I propose here...Well, me and many more people, not just me, but this is something that as soon as you say it you are a Nazi, so you have to be careful, It doesn't matter to me anymore, I'm cured of horror... I say what I think and if you like it, well and if you don't, then let them lynch me, it doesn't matter to me... it can't be that they come in that Balance. more than half a million a year, it is not normal... have decent conditions and make the youth who are unemployed. and the three million unemployed that we have, so go putting them in... Obviously I'm going to tell you say one thing, if we have been with suicidal immigration policies since 1997, 20 or so years, this started with Anar, that's why I tell you about the left and the right, it's worthless here... And with birth rates exactly anyway, what's happening? That obviously when we take measures to solve it, that is, that is going to happen... But of course, to solve it it has to be like this... They also told Bukele, no, but if it happens this will increase violence and Va, and it increased, but then it ended... All this left says, no, it is that we have to decrease, they say it, we have to decrease at all levels... Well, if they like it so much the decrease, why can't we decrease for a few years, while we make birth rates measures, a different immigration policy and integration of what is already here? Because there are people here who will have to leave, obviously, and then there will be people who will have to be encouraged to integrate for normal functioning... So, that is what I propose, ending that massiveness, decreasing in an orderly manner. And then later when those plans are working, grow again... That is, I do not defend myself against Malthusianism, but it is an objective question of whether you have been there for almost 30 years. With a suicidal policy, fixing it is complicated, it is not a magical thing... That is, if you come to power tomorrow and put an end to illegal immigration, imagine that they succeed... They arrive, they win the elections in a few years, they end illegal immigration .and half a million people a year continue to come... The problem is not going to be solved, it will feed back more... So, these are things that must be taken into account. Dogastic measures will have to be taken.. And I tell you that the most important thing for Me is to avoid the ghettos, which already exist... How? Breaking up those ghettos... And if the police have to come in and people have to be separated. As happens in the Nordic countries, it seems that everyone can take measures except us... And what they do is, for For example, 30% of the maximum immigrant population in a city, for example... If there are more people going to the next city, they can't all be together... Why? Because if there is not something homogeneous to integrate or assimilate, what they do is feed off each other and they will never integrate... In areas where, for example, in France, there are 70% of people of immigrant origin. that has not been integrated over the years, how are they going to integrate into the 30% that remains, who surely also have a very high average age? It is impossible .\"\n\nFrom time 01:05:42.960000 to 01:05:42.960000 Interviewer says: \"And we tend to congregate too.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:05:45.120000 until 01:06:28 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Of course...In all places in the world...That's why we have to do something now with the issue of massiveness...But it's that immigration, the problem is not the illegal one, it is the model... Because the legal immigration of half a million a year is not a problem... And the issue of nationalities, of giving nationality to People .who, for example, does not even speak Spanish, that is a problem too... Because it is like they have given themselves... In fact, since 2010 there are more than one and a half million nationalities... That is outrageous for a country...It's outrageous...So, we have to take...My objective with the book is to put the immigration issue at the center of the debate.and to debate it...That is the objective. ..In other words, more than about measures, I also speak, I speak about analysis of the phenomenon as it is now. and why we have arrived here... And the policies that are made now... And it is a serious problem.. Just look if it is serious that the UN or other countries,\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:06:25.480000 until 01:06:25.480000 Interviewer says: \"And the policies that are made now.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:06:31 to 01:07:25.320000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"to calculate, for example, how many immigrants there are in a country, they calculate it based on the people who were not born in the country...In Spain, for example, doesn't do it like that... That is, they don't count all the people who have been given Nationality as being of immigrant origin... They say, no, it's just that if it's not racist, that's it, but It is unreal...In Spain there is no less than 12% immigration...In Spain we are already at 16, only with those born outside...Because, of course, the people who are born here and raised in a ghetto .and they don't relate to anything, those people who were born here are Spanish...If you don't have Spanish culture, you're not Spanish...That's just it, we have to start from that base...I don't care the color of the skin, it doesn't matter to me exactly... But it is a cultural question, it is an ethnic question... The question is, if you have grown up apart and you do not have our culture, you do not function as our society functions, You really aren't from here...I'm not saying I can't live here, but why give nationality to people who aren't from here? In other words, it is like despising being Spanish, like everyone can be Spanish...And that is a mistake.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:07:26.320000 to 01:07:38.400000 Interviewer says: \"And the imbalance also at the economic level, at the fiscal level, health, on many levels is tremendous...Then, within your party, the economic proposal \"I mean, how do they set it up, how do they pose it?\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:07:43 until 01:10:19.400000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Well, we, as I have told you, are leaving, because we have no intention of governing or entering any government... That is, if We would get a representative, we would go to war there...We have the approach that we have told you...I mean, I have told you why it is what we are going to do...I mean, I really believe that there are priorities and in the economic...And you can say my vision that I think I would do a Purification of how everything state is, because I think it is very inoperative...Not in the sense that the State must be eliminated, for Of course, I don't think that, but I do think it should work differently... Even at the level of the self-employed, for example, the issue of Quotas, of paying to work, of the current sections, some are very unfair and that make people have a really bad time... That is, we would ask many questions to optimize what there is... That would be the first... The second would be to put an end, due to the issue of sovereignty, with the economic dependencies with other countries, which is another serious problem we have, especially with the European Union, which, yes, money arrives, although less and less arrives, and in the end we will have to pay much more than what we receive... That it does not work, that it is not an optimal development...Obviously, at the labor level, we are going to always promote Measures, whatever they are, and carry out a labor reform, which is in favor of the workers, not like what there is now, and don't do what Yolanda does, no, it's that I'm less and less unemployed than ever before... And there are the discontinuous permanent workers, which is how I send you half a year on unemployment, and that's a gigantic number of people... I mean, in that sense I am clear...But we don't have one...How to say it, if we have the economic plan, it is posted on the Internet, in the political program, which is not Electoral, but we think that right now That, in Concrete, is not something that we can change or develop... So, when we have the Congress in the middle of next year, before the Europeans, we will do a deeper development in that sense, but keep in mind Keep in mind that we are like a party in Movements, we have started due to a legal imperative, under construction... We before were like pro committee, pro workers front, because we were there to create it and we in Congress had it a year or so ago... I mean, in reality, we are like very new... We have been there for two years in total, two and a bit years, three, but we are really starting to get going... So, it is evident that we are not going to have, what I said before of the measures, concrete measures for everything...But come on, what I can say is that people say, no, they are going to implement communism tomorrow...No, that is real because even on the workers' front the majority of people are not...But the overwhelming majority of people are not communists or anything...I mean, they are people who care about their country, who obviously have a perspective in favor of the workers. ..That is a slightly more personal perspective of yours, the issue of communism.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:10:19.400000 to 01:10:22.520000 Interviewer says: \"That's a slightly more personal perspective of yours, the topic of communism... Ah, okay, I didn't know.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:10:22.520000 until 01:11:11.600000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Ah, okay, I didn't know...But the front didn't...I mean, the front is betting on, well, a ...How to say it? A relaunch, a National reconstruction. and precisely with Popular sovereignty. to take the measures we need at all levels... Economic, political, dependency, immigration, absolutely everything... But It is that, that we are an organization under construction. And that we do not deceive people... That is, when we say we are going to focus on This, that is what we are going to do... And we have said since we are going to put the rest of the things in a secondary place...But as I said, one of the points is the Workers' struggle, the fight for the defense of interests...Because many people say about rights, I believe that this is insufficient, that it is for the interests of the workers...Which I believe that Sumari these people do not do, because for them the oppressed subjects are others, not the workers.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:11:15.480000 to 01:11:17.080000 Interviewer says: \"Of course, so you don't want to go for broke, if you don't have clear pillars to defend this.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:11:19.520000 until 01:11:23.880000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"What you're saying, you see us anywhere whatever. And you're going to say, it's the same thing... Well, I don't deceive nobody .\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:11:26.720000 to 01:11:46.680000 Interviewer says: \"And then, I was left wanting to see more of what your life is like... That is, on a personal level and outside, maybe about the party, about the business issue and so on... Because you said something that caught my attention, that for example you sell books and you say, of course, but this is the result of my work... So, where do you go? It creates friction, I really understand that it is when an individual becomes very rich without working.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:11:52.600000 to 01:12:34.040000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"And based on the exploitation of others it would be for me the...But well, for me, the Workers' Front, for example, also aspires to win to the self-employed and to defend their interests, even the small neighborhood businessman, etc... And we are also going to defend their Interests against the oligarchy and against large companies... So, of course, it is not the same... I know that this shocks people, but they elected me as president, because I am a guy with drive, I am a guy with charisma, so, well, I am very useful for this... But I say again that I The fact that the front defends is what appears in the program...I can defend on a personal level...You will no longer see me in places defending things that are not the front...I don't know that they ask me for my opinion personal, but we, the Workers' Front, do not now aspire to...\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:12:39.360000 to 01:12:42.400000 Interviewer says: \"To implement communism...No, no, it's not communist...It's really not communist.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:12:40.320000 until 01:13:36.600000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"No, no, it's not a communist... It's just that it's not really a communist... There are people there who do consider that the program, which for us is minimal, is good for the country and for the workers, but we are in that dynamic...And we are working on the construction of the front now...We consider that the other thing is like playing games. imaginary things...I mean, it's unreal. It's unreal...I'm going to say something a little controversial now, but what the communist movement is is dead at a global level...What there is now is low-woke or parties that are in absolute decomposition...It is something that is quite dead...Just as I consider that what the fascist movements were, Etcetera, I believe that they are quite dead too...So, moving through dichotomies of not This really is, you always try to do that... I have gotten rid of moving around labels, etc.... I prefer to do things that I really consider to be along the path of what I see as a society. optimal...And that's what I'm working on at the front and that's why I'm at the front...If not, I wouldn't be there. \"I would be somewhere else.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:13:33.800000 to 01:14:17.560000 Interviewer says: \"And I'm working on that at the front and that's why I'm at the front...Of course...Yes, I see that you have a very focused approach. feet on the ground right now...I mean, to say...Because I saw a fragment, for example, of the debate you had on Jordi Wild's podcast with Juan Ram\u00f3n Rayo...Yes...And of course I mean, on both sides I saw situations as very Idealistic. To say, both on the part of Juan Ram\u00f3n, of something extremely liberal that, at least, I don't imagine could happen in the short or medium term... And also The communist system that you propose as ideal, I also think that, as you were saying, you are something very difficult to... Of course, yes, of course.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:14:17.560000 to 01:14:33.280000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Of course, yes, of course... The material conditions are important... There are many people who talk about, no, the revolution. ..When did the...? And the thing is, the revolution of What? that is, in your imaginary house... I mean, it is unreal... And the hell they asked us both to do that debate. ..Of course...It is a more ideological and intellectual question, in the sense of what would be our ideal model of issues.\"\n\nFrom instant 01:14:30.600000 to 01:14:30.600000 Interviewer says: \"Sure.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:14:39.120000 until 01:15:10.120000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"But I tell you, I am focused on what I have said... That is, not me, with the front, I am not calling to the Socialist revolution. Because it is stupid... In other words, it is like calling something in the current phase with the Current conditions. imaginary... That is why I dedicate myself to building something that for me is minimal, but that I think that if we achieved it it would be something very revolutionary...And then I am focused on that...And people sometimes point at me and tell me, no, you are a traitor...Yes, but it is just that you are talking. of non-binary bathrooms, that's not the revolution either...And that's what those people do...So me, it's like everything geeky, like I've separated myself from it.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:15:10.120000 to 01:15:10.120000 Interviewer says: \"So me, it's like everything geeky, like I've separated myself from it.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:15:14.680000 to 01:17:09.760000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"Even the red Geek thing, which to me seems, sorry I'm going to say it, but like a bit of a wanker... I mean, it's one thing that doesn't make sense... I am a person whose thesis is about the republic of the civil war... That is to say, I do study and read about it, but precisely because I study about it it seems like a lack of Respect.do what other people do, really...I believe that I am consistent with the reality that exists and with what I can do with the reality that exists...And I think that, look, I am going to put a historical example, if you allow me... Yes, yes... People, even when talking about the Bolsheviks, etc., one of the slogans with which they became Great was peace, bread and land... I mean, I want to tell you that you see that and say, Damn, it's not a slogan that you say, My God... But of course the material conditions that they had and that were, much better than those of now in the sense of politicization of the people, the capacity for mobilization, was that... I mean, even those people knew how to adapt at the time... And what the majority of communist people do now is like copying the ascendant era of the revolution, from that time, that cycle has already passed, all that has already happened, and they try to copy it, bring it now, and then mix it with the Woke and a mutant monstrosity emerges for me, which of course is a parody ...Then you don't approach anyone...There are a lot of very old people with very different appearances...But I'm talking to you now about people who were like communists, but communists are 80 years old now...I want to tell you People who have lived and tell me, Damn, what I'm doing is this is what needs to be done now... And they tell me those things... And when a modern 20-year-old comes to me who hasn't done anything in His Life, he tells me, no, no, they are traitors, because it's like Retire, respect yourself a little and let us do it, because the important thing is to do things and do those things for the benefit of what you believe...And I think that \"to be authorizing about imaginary things right now is the word, it is the word, it is imaginary, it is smoke, it is in the air,\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:17:13.480000 to 01:17:13.480000 Interviewer says: \"everything is floating and I was like that before.\"\n\nFrom the moment 01:17:16.320000 to 01:17:41.160000 Roberto Vaquero says: \"When I have been in the military for 20 years, well, 21 years and I am 37 years old and I have been in the military for 21 years, that is, I have been in it all my life.\" of Communist Groups and I have always been leaving, I have been moving away because I saw that it is unreal and they are the same 10,15 people, because there are no more, repeating the same mistakes cyclically...And I said, of course, I \"I'm a very critical person, that's the problem... So since I don't follow Pax, I said, get out, I'm leaving...
