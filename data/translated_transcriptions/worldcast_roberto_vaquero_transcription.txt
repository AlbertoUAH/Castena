From the minute 00:00:05.400000 to 00:00:07.400000 Roberto Vaquero says: "And I think those years were thrown into the trash...Do you hear?"

From the minute 00:00:10.400000 to 00:00:12.400000 Interviewer says: "Where do you start? Because this is very broad...Well, a bit of a summary of the most movie-inducing stuff."

From the minute 00:00:14.950000 to 00:00:18.950000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I am from a nation also called... well, it was called communist reconstruction at that time, to go fight against the Islamic State "

From the minute 00:00:24.950000 to 00:00:30.950000 Interviewer says: "No, fighting with a rifle...Posting tweets...So you weren't tweeting, I was in the trenches...There were people, yes, who were in the trenches... Would you say that a revolution is needed?"

From the minute 00:00:25.250000 to 00:01:06.290000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Posting tweets... So you weren't tweeting, I was in the trenches... There were people, yes, who were in the trenches... and who has displaced what could be called biological women... And not only that, but they call them ter, that is, because the Nazis are going to beat them to places... We live in a dystopian situation in all areas...Immigration model, the issue of women, the education of children by hypersensualizing them and putting horrific theories, from my point of view, into their heads...weakness is being encouraged...There are people who are ashamed of being Spanish "There are people who are ashamed of being white. There are people who are ashamed of being otorosexual. There comes a time when it is ridiculous."

From the minute 00:01:07.730000 to 00:01:11.730000 Interviewer says: "Something that I really liked about your speech is the defense of the flag, damn it, because for me this is pure common sense."

From the minute 00:01:14.730000 to 00:01:21.730000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Pedro Sánchez and Podemos, it makes me laugh..And the fascists are everyone else..And there are no fascists or communists there ..It's like a scam, they are making fun of people."

From the minute 00:01:29.740000 to 00:03:01.740000 Interviewer says: "Well here we are, one more day, one more week...A San Miguel, in this case, with Roberto Vaquero...How are you? Everything well?.Nice to be here..Welcome..The truth is that I am glad that you came..We are now with the 23J..We are trying to make a little electoral content..That our listeners have a little a clear vision..I see that the media, in the end, today are very manipulated..Very biased..And that the parties, whatever type they are, do not normally have free space to express themselves calmly..Then I I would like to talk to you about two things... On the one hand, about you... As a personal figure... And after the party that you have been representing... I also understand right now... And I must tell you that it seems to me, you know? your game, and well, in particular your videos, what I have seen of you... It seems to me that it is quite fresh air... Looking at what was seen... I mean, I see that, lately, during recent times It's like the population buys packages... You know? Well, if you're on the left, you have to defend this, this and this... And if you're on the right, you have to defend this, this and this... And it's like that there is no criterion...And your party, in the end, is like a bit misleading...I suppose it is difficult to position...Left, right...It has features, right? So, at least, I know that we will be disagree on some things...But at least it seems like fresh air to me...You know? I think it smells closed and Spanish politics, finally...I guess..."

From the minute 00:03:04.680000 to 00:03:55.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I don't know if you will ask me about that later or not...But it seems to me that it is like a game of puppets to deceive people. And deep down, although it seems that everything is very polarized and that they confront each other a lot, they often defend, in essence, the same thing. And, well, the political landscape is divided by them, firstly by financing. Because since they have already been in power, they have rights, that is, they have already had representation, they have the right to money, they have the right to more space, they have the right to many things than the parties that do not have representation or the new ones. They don't have them..We have to collect signatures, for example, which is outrageous..We are going to present ourselves in 51 constituencies out of 52..The only thing missing is Melilla..And, of course, it is difficult to get.. Then I see other parties that try and in such a short time it is impossible... So they play with an absolute advantage... and what they do is perpetuate a little what there is... So it is very difficult to have fresh air. there is a little, close the window."

From the minute 00:04:01.140000 to 00:04:01.140000 Interviewer says: "as left or right. Do you consider yourself, I suppose, outside of...?"

From the minute 00:04:09.690000 to 00:04:46.690000 Roberto Vaquero says: "what can anyone who sees us imagine... And I believe that those years were thrown away. and I was putting myself at risk for things that in In reality, they weren't even my own interests... And I came out of there very renegade... And I don't defend either the left or the right... I think that's a dichotomy that is already out of date. And what there is is people dividing themselves so much. those who are more moderate on the left or right, as well as their radical versions that when things happen in the end they always end up joining the big guy... And we have broken with that... So some call us fascists, others call us communists, we They call for everything, everyone...But it doesn't matter to us...We want to build something different...and we do want to be a little bit of that fresh air that you talk about."

From the minute 00:04:49.690000 to 00:06:06.690000 Interviewer says: "Before getting into the matter, I would like to send a message to the audience. Because you may have seen the other day we had Abascal here...We invite everyone...They were the first to volunteer...Now you are here...And well, if before the elections we manage to bring Pessoa, EPP and whoever wants to come, then great on our part...But something I haven't liked anything about the Abascal issue. It's the number of DMs I've received from messages saying. But how do you think about giving a voice to...? And this has not only been told to me with Abascal, but They tell me. Well, we bring an aunt who says she's half a Martian... How can you think of giving her a voice? We bring anyone... Anyone, right? So... and I know they're going to tell me. say with you too..100%..Totally. Totally..And I say, the argument they use is like it's dangerous..And I say, let's see, let's see..What is dangerous is not listening to a little bit of everything. .and try to extract what you consider to be positive from each of the arguments.and have your own criteria and build your opinion,.do not buy what was said at the beginning of the packages..Then, I would invite the audience to listen without bias ,.to listen calmly to what you and anyone else have to say..and to form their own opinion because they seem like sheep to me, literally...Everyone who is writing that to me...How do you think about giving them a voice? How can you think? How do you think of that? Go fuck yourself... I mean, I mean, you know? You understand what I'm saying, right?"

From the minute 00:06:12.690000 to 00:06:56.690000 Roberto Vaquero says: "There is like a dictatorship of what is politically correct. And as soon as you leave that single thought, of those dogmas, you are immediately the worst thing you can do." you can imagine.. And I think it is one thing that shows that we are in a decadent society. and that I think we should break with that.. Enough of the fact that there has to be a message. and any alternative that there may be, it must be shot. ..And I think it is a mistake..That is, in the case of Abascal, in a party that has representation,..well I understand that I called the milestones to speak..For me, for example, when I go to Barzona and other places. They tell me demonstrations and they try to hit me.. In other words, it is a dystopia. It is a true dystopia.. Because they are people who supposedly defend democracy, freedom of expression, etc., but they immediately point out that it is speech. of dangerous hatred. Anything in a critical way, because they don't really value what you say. But you are directly bad, you are dangerous, you are outside, you can't have any space."

From the minute 00:06:59.060000 to 00:08:11.060000 Interviewer says: "Of course...And besides, I don't come here to debate with anyone, really...I come to listen to all points of view...I, for For example, I am a businessman. In fact I know that you have a more communist approach. I know that you will be against what I do, but when I talk to you, I listen to your point of view. I am going to try to understand and also put myself in your place..And in the end, surely the conclusion will be that you are not right..I am not right either, but it is a matter of priorities..Maybe you prioritize the community,.I prioritize, I am more selfish, maybe and it can be like that... And that's it... But then we will get into that... What I would like to start with is with your personal figure, with who Roberto Baquero is, because they have told me a bit of your story .and I think it's cool..It's like a bit of a movie..It's a movie as it is..And then you're a figure that attracts attention, you know, accustomed to the politicians we're seeing, well you see Íñigo Rejón and then you seem like you came out of Mortal Kombat, well tell us a little about that... Outside of politics I have heard Syria, prison... Where do you start, because this is very broad... Well, a very movie summary "

From the minute 00:08:10.830000 to 00:10:11.830000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Well, a summary of the most filmy... If it is about Syria, for example, we have always collaborated a lot with the Kurdish community. and Spain always has somewhat murky relations with Turkey, which is a country that for me is a dictatorship, but there will be people who will tell you that it is authoritarian, but well, it is not a place where people can do what whoever wants..Then here there also began to be persecution of the Kurdish community here..So well, we said,.this we have to start organizing with them and we started to work with them..They tap my phones and everything in 2012, 2013, simply for being with these people, for helping people in the Kurdish community. When the Islamic State thing happens, well, we are people with many concerns in this sense, we are against Islamism , to the Islamization of Spain and also in general... But when you say we, who are you? Well, we, the group that founded the Workers' Front, which was the Grupo Motor, is the group where I come from. So, this is what we're talking about in 2009, 2010, 2011, that is, a job from quite some time ago. When the Islamic State thing happened, we, even our friends, family members of our friends, were murdered in Syria... So well, we are very affected by that... And in that context, I am also from a relationship that is called, well, it was called Communist Reconstruction at that time... And a call is made similar to that of the international brigades that existed in Spain, here in the Civil War... Well, the same, but to go fight against the Islamic State... So, they accuse me... Well, in fact, they say that it is approved, that is I can say it... They say that I am the one who organized it, because people go to fight there... And well, when they return, they arrest them, they start to put pressure,... they mount a trial based on all this... And for fighting against the Islamic State, they put us on trial... They have me on remand, I was only on remand... Then I was not sentenced, serving a sentence... And at the end of a 27-year petition they put me in. for being the bad guy at the end of the game, because he stayed for a year and six months, and I'm still fighting to be clean. That's the situation I have now."

From the minute 00:10:17.290000 to 00:10:23.290000 Interviewer says: "because you said fight against the Islamic State, and today in today's society, fighting can mean posting tweets. So you weren't tweeting, "You were in the trench."

From the minute 00:10:23.160000 to 00:11:40.160000 Roberto Vaquero says: "So you weren't tweeting, you were in the trench... There were people who were in the trench... They arrested me for being the investigator or the organizer, and I spent 49 days in the anti-terrorist isolation Festivals, and everything happens to me there. In fact, people say I should write a book about it, because everything happens to me. And well , I was a certain way before I got there...Well, I was a guy who always trained a lot,...I always gave a lot of importance to studying, training, etc...What it is for me...Before the jail too... It was like that before... I left my shoulder injury, I stopped training, and when they put me in jail I started training a lot... And when I got out, well, I ended up competing... I mean, I started I started training a team without ending up competing... They told me that with my shoulder I couldn't train again, I started doing rehabilitation like an animal, I started training and ended up competing... I stopped studying to start working on my job. day, I went out, I got a degree in geography in history, I got my master's degree and I'm doing my doctorate... I mean, I kind of disciplined myself a lot there... I mean, I was a person in and of myself. Compared to a person who only goes out to parties and so on, I was very organized. But when I left there, I came out transformed. I was a person who dedicated myself to working to achieve my goals. And I didn't look at anything else. And I also dedicate myself to building myself, also to contribute to others. So, of course, instead of destroying me, what made me was much stronger. I came out much stronger there. Mentally and for everyone. the levels...And the people with whom you shared time in prison?"

From the minute 00:10:52.820000 to 00:11:44.550000 Interviewer says: "Already before, already...And the people with whom you shared time in prison. Did you notice a similar effect? ​​Or was it something in you What disciplined you?"

From the minute 00:11:49.930000 to 00:12:50.930000 Roberto Vaquero says: "From seeing people who were going to ten years, maybe eleven... I was with a boy who had been in prison longer. How old was he? When I was...31 years old...And of course, now I write to you, I send you things, I try to help...I mean, I try to do things to help people who are like this...But I saw a lot of broken people...And I saw people who, despite having been there for a long time and being a little bad, got ahead, made an effort... So I saw it as an example... I was there with some scary people... I mean, I was there with people, especially the first time I was in Soto, I was with Arcan tigers, I was with Albanian and Italian mafiosi... I was with very curious people... I was with ETA prisoners... I was with all kinds of people... And there were some of them that I learned a lot from..And I also learned to relate in another way..I learned, for example, with this guy who was Serbia..I learned to train in a different way..Because he was a physical phenomenon.. And I dedicated myself to doing that...I read, I trained and I prepared...And in fact when I went out there, that's when I proposed the plan to do the Fento Obrero and all this...I mean, it was actually a very short, but very productive for me."

From the minute 00:12:54.690000 to 00:12:58.690000 Interviewer says: "And going back, when they decide to go there, how many people leave? In other words, these are four crazy people who from one day to the next say ..."

From the minute 00:13:03.240000 to 00:13:37.520000 Roberto Vaquero says: "It was people who really loved... How many people? Well, in the trial only two appear... So we are going to say that There are two of them..And they were there at the front with the International Brigade..And there were people from all countries..And the only country he faces in the trial, is the only group, is us..In fact, the people who said they were like our bosses in other places....And the people wrote for....As such?.Yes...But yes, and there were people from Italy, there were people from a lot of Germany, there were people from England, there were people from many countries."

From the minute 00:13:46.430000 to 00:13:47.430000 Interviewer says: "No, it starts in high school... I started becoming politicized in high school..."

From the minute 00:13:47.210000 to 00:17:07.350000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I began to become politicized at the institute, in student assemblies, a little in the anti-fascist thing at the beginning too... And in the end, I started reading more..I have always been a person who has read a lot, with many concerns..And I began to realize a little about what I call the fashion of the revolution..That there are people who have a kind of pact, they They dress a certain way, they talk a certain way, they go to concerts, they like it a lot... I started there, but I soon started to be like the weird one... And I started having problems from the beginning... And I started moving away , separating myself until I founded an organization in itself, which is a bit of the embryo of everything we are now... And we have arrived until today... In other words, it has been like a process of rupture that when I came out of prison I believe This is the moment when we said we have to break up with these people... In other words, this is a burden... The only thing it does is not get closer to normal people, which is who we want to get closer to.. Because they criticize me a lot and they tell me, it's not that you are no longer dedicated to the fight for the workers, you have betrayed... And I don't know, in my neighborhood, I live in Leganés, in San Nicasio, which is a working-class immigrant neighborhood. And when I talk to people, whether they are Spanish or from abroad, their problems are that they don't have a job, that their job is rubbish, that they don't make ends meet, that their daughter can't go out starting at 9 at night because something happens to them, so they don't steal... They have a series of problems that we, or at least I, share, I live in that situation too and I want to solve it... And all these groups, although They are very radical on the left, they are more concerned with invented oppressions, with fashions that come from the United States... And I don't think they are beneficial to anyone, it is something for the people who drive the business... So I kind of say, now From a very young age, I began to break with that... Within what is the antifa scene in its day or in the more communist or more extreme left vibe,...we were very badly seen at that time, because we did not follow these things. We didn't like to follow trends... We can be the worst for many people and we can be criticized for many things, but of course if we are consistent with what we think, it is impossible for us to be criticized, because you may like it or not. That is each person's question... But we are not Groucho Marx Marxists, I have some principles and if you don't like them I have others. It is what it is... In other words, we are like that and if we like it well and if we don't, well, that's just how we are. We don't have to deceive anyone... I mean, I totally deny it. People call it woke ideology, I call it ideological postmodernism, but it amounts to the same thing... That is, this whole issue of globalism that is also called that many times, yes totally against it... I consider myself a patriot. I have nothing to do with that... When they say to me, no, it's because you're right-wing because you're a patriot, right? Yes, but I defend the class struggle, right? So it's like people's heads explode, but following PACS is the only thing they do without using it... That is, you can have things right, but there are things that They are wrong and you defend them solely and exclusively because it is your fashion, right? It is like your urban tribe and that is how they work. Yes, it is a criterion..Yes, it is a mistake. They have criticized me a lot for sitting down to talk to people who are not of my ideology, supposedly according to them... So I have debated with many liberals, I have even debated with real right-wing people, with conservatives, with woke people too. It's like if he even wants to sit with me to debate and be a person you can talk to, I don't have any problem... And that makes me practically first a legitimizer of fascism and then directly a fascist... And it's like, well, I don't know, maybe we have different visions of what a fascist is, really."

From the minute 00:17:15.900000 to 00:17:52.060000 Interviewer says: "Because what I see and what happens to me, having Bascal here the other day, happens to me with people I know who are perhaps from Vox... And everyone defends, for example, the bulls because they are in the pack... And that's it, and that's what it is. And I say, for me that's what, I don't know, I mean, it's a lack of judgment... It's just left, right, up, down, I don't care, right? And then you mentioned the word revolution before... You would say, let's see, in some way, the environment is already a little revolutionized, really... But you would say that it is necessary a revolution that is happening, that is happening but badly."

From the minute 00:18:05.400000 to 00:19:49.400000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I believe that it is the opposite, what is degenerating society at accelerated rates... People who even know without hammers, you can see in the iconography of many WoW and organizations... They talk about socialism, the revolution and of course, I think... I also want it to be separated, that the people who see this separate what I am in itself from the workers' front ...Because I do come from a tradition, I do consider myself a communist, but the people of the workers' front do not... There are people who do, but many people who do not... I have a broad front and there is a program that for me is of minimums, which for others is maximums, but we all agree that there is, what you said about common sense, that there are certain things that many of us can agree on and we want to be a transversal movement. So I have no problem answering anything about communism or anything, but I want people to separate me a little from where I come from, from what the front itself is, because if not I can harm them and It's not my intention..Logical, logical..And about what you were saying, to me these people seem the other way around, the glitter counterrevolution..They seem to me to be the most systemic, because when you say, no, it means that for me They are the most rational. People say, how can these people be rational? And it seems to me that the terminology here is important. What they are, they are systemic...The left has gone from paralyzing countries, from wanting to transform, from wanting to reach socialism, from wanting to do things, to suddenly what they do is maintain what exists...I mean , they make small changes, what they call small advances... But advances for whom, advances of what... So what I see is that it is like a big scam and they are the most systemic, because how are they going to defend the revolution in the sense of transformation of society. If they have the same discourse and the same ideological pack as Amazon, for example, or Netflix? In other words, since when can the subversive radical left have the same line as the large business corporations? "It breaks your head when you analyze that. And that's what many people don't see, because people are very deceived."

From the minute 00:18:54.760000 to 00:20:40.920000 Interviewer says: "Logical, logical... Of course... But in the end, I'm lately regretting doing this podcast, because since I bring people who sometimes They have their conspiracy approach, the algorithms contaminate me, I already get conspiracy things, and I'm already a little bit involved in the game too... So the other day it hasn't come out yet, but we recorded with an expert in masonry, for example, .and he was talking about how it really doesn't even have to be from the United States, but rather something higher, agenda 2030, everything... I mean, it also sounds conspiratorial, but when you talk to this guy who already The podcast will come out, well you may start to believe it... I think it comes from the United States... That's what I was going to ask you... I mean, I think that many times conspiracies..."

From the minute 00:20:39.550000 to 00:22:35.930000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I was going to ask you that... And I think that many times conspiracies, what the history of the conspiracy does is blur a lot and distance people a lot. people...And I think it doesn't work because people say,...no, it's that the 2030 agenda is a conspiracy theory, you put agenda 2030 web on Google...you give it to me and it appears on the web, that is, It is not hidden..It is not a conspiracy, it is something that people do not bother to read, but it is there..And this whole ideological pack that they are imposing on us is something that is coming from the United States..Even the right from here it is copying to the right from there, which is the reaction to what is happening there... The whole issue that they talk about cheating, about people who are beginning to be fed up with how the United States is evolving... And that they are copying that type of right here... That is, the right that is resurgent here in Spain has much more to do with that American style than with the traditional Spanish radical right of farangistas forming squads and going down the street... That does not happen in Spain..The right that exists here is very copied from the one that is emerging, very copied from that of the United States..I think that copying the United States all the time, which is what we have been doing for decades, I think not It is very positive for us..Well, in the Anglo-Saxon world, I would say..I believe that this comes from the Anglo-Saxon world..It has been imported to Europe and it is also being imported to Spain..And it is a continuous issue..I I remember when I started practicing this inclusive language... All of this was something that when it arrived I laughed and said, how pathetic, this is never going to be imposed here... Who in their right mind is going to do this? ?.And after a while...I mean, when time passed, they kicked me out of the assembly for not accepting it...And then I read that in the United States it had happened 30 years before or 20 years before...And the issue of Transgenderism, that movement did not exist here before. The feminism that existed here was different. It has displaced it. It has displaced it. It is something that constantly comes in waves because the dominant culture here is North American. At the level of type of series, of movie, of music, of....Everything comes there...And it is one thing that in the end will fall on people...Social networks...It's that everything comes there."

From the minute 00:22:32.630000 to 00:22:38.070000 Interviewer says: "Of course...Yes, it has a lot of influence on what the lifestyle is."

From the minute 00:22:41.610000 to 00:22:52.610000 Roberto Vaquero says: "And at the level of ideology about the population and culture, it is the culture that pushes national cultures... And national ones are being eroded and everything "The world is taking on this very cosmopolitan globalist culture...And what is being done is erasing it from here instead of continuing to evolve and adapt things that are not from here."

From moment 00:22:58.730000 to 00:22:58.730000 Interviewer says: "And do you think it comes from governments, from companies?"

From the minute 00:23:03.410000 to 00:24:04.410000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Because I believe that governments are at the service of those who finance them...So, who finances governments? Well, those big companies... Who do they depend on at the level of image and other issues as well? So, I think that both the left... Well, the left more PSOE style, more of the big parties, as Margallo said, centrists... Both the PSOE and the PP defend similar things. In fact, Margallo says that the 2030 Agenda is the Gospel. And keep in mind that it is the party that came from the dictatorship, which was very conservative people. And now, Look, what positions they are having... And that is because they are adapting party speeches to every North American... The fact is that even the parties here were not like that... The Socialist Party in Spain was a grassroots party, a party that came from the workerism, the union... It has become a party that uses everything as a trap... It wants to get votes from whoever... It is not focused on a segment, the population, and it defends its interests... It is like it is focused on what It goes well...And the PP is exactly the same. They have become all-out parties... And that is also imported. Why? Because the Republican Party and the Republic Party are also like that... We copy a lot."

From the minute 00:24:06.410000 to 00:24:09.410000 Interviewer says: "I guess they also force each other to be able to compete. If you are going to get everything, I also have to go and get everything to be able to compete with you "

From the minute 00:24:18.770000 to 00:24:31.770000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Even the migratory models that exist have a perception that is similar...The spokespersons against racism in large organizations, etc., are literally copied from how they are in the United States...And it is something that is very global. They approach it in a fairly global way."

From the minute 00:24:36.410000 to 00:24:45.410000 Interviewer says: "And pulling the cable, because we follow either governments, corporations... It strikes me what the interest behind all this uauquism could be. ..I mean, get to what point. Who cares?"

From the minute 00:24:48.380000 to 00:31:17.830000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Well, I believe that on an economic level they have a lot of profit... They have a great business set up... In which what they say is acceptable and They induce a type of consumption...And what they do is implement it. And it is money and money and money...In fact now there is beginning to be a reaction,...even the companies that have dedicated themselves to being pure business in this sense For example, Disney, Netflix, etc., people are starting to get fed up. There is a reaction, even their sales are going down. Now an interesting period is going to open, but so far what there has been is an incredible business. Because even with the issue of transgenderism, etc., there is an incredible business behind it... What they do is make money, political profit and the ability to maintain their control... And on top of that with a cloak of progress, from which the fascists of I don't know who to complain..And I have seen it with the riots in France..some who are in mayors, saying that we must support the riots.and that it is a question of the revolution in France..And there were people who sent accents for immigrants, churches, libraries, attacking people because of their skin color in the street... It's like a dystopia... I mean, what has happened in France is that entire areas have been lumpenized... There are people who live in the marginality separated from society.. And what the immigration model does is encourage this to happen more and more.. And there are millions of people who do not feel like they are from that country and who are also like the fashion of the suburbs. that as soon as whatever happens, they go out into the street... That is, a boy dies in that accident, because the guy didn't shoot his head like they say... He dies, okay, a shame, he is declared a criminal, etc. It doesn't matter... He doesn't die, I don't think he should have died... But hey, what he did isn't right either... But the thing is, this guy dies, France burns... he stabs babies in a park ..Which is very good, Luis..Yes, but did France take to the streets? It didn't come out, nothing happened..I think that's when France has to burn and say that there has to be a change. .But nothing happens there..A common criminal dies and everything burns..It cannot be, it cannot be..In other words, the implementation of these measures at all levels, both migratory and non-migratory, has led to dystopian situations...Feminism has gone from...The feminist movement was committed to separating itself from men, to enhance women, a series of issues that don't seem right to me either...Because I believe in equality, but in real equality, in quotas, discrimination, etc. But the thing is, it has gone from that to now those who are in charge, and that has displaced what could be called women biological..And not only that, but they call them TERF, that is, because the Nazis,.and they are going to stick them in places..The other day, the CNT, which is a union not at all suspected of being right-wing, .nothing like that, they held a rally and tried to beat them.for doing an act against the erasure of women, which is what is happening..Immigration model, the issue of women, the education of children.and persexualizing them and putting horrible theories in their heads, from my point of view. Promoting individualism, but at a level that is destroying people. when there are more mental problems than ever, when there are supposedly more means and more professionals than ever.. Weakness is being encouraged in our society.. People are becoming weaker.. There are people who say, of course, since the white man is now weak, well, of course, these things happen because Weakness is not being promoted throughout the world. There are people who are ashamed of being Spanish, there are people who are ashamed of being white, there are people who are ashamed of being otorosexual. There comes a time when it is ridiculous and you see truly dystopian things...The other day at the gay pride party, I'm going to say something that maybe isn't outrageous...they had a nudist march and naked guys came out dancing.and I looked at the side and there were little children...It's not normal, it's not normal...I mean, they can do whatever they want, but why do there have to be some children there? Why do they have to do it in the street? Why do they have to do it in the street? Why do we have a pride month? Well, I tell you, why do we have a pride month? Because it is a great business... They did one day and said, this is a business, we do it for a month... Do they really care about people's sexual orientations? No, because in Spain, the vast majority of people, It doesn't matter what sexual orientation you have... That's your thing, your life, and you'll do what you want, no one gets involved... When talking about Spain, it's not that Spain is horrible, it's a country homophobic, racist..If that happened, there would not be 8 million immigrants in Spain..It is unreal..If you tell me, no, we are going to talk about Hungary, well we can sit down and talk about Hungary, but in Spain, which is a country that opens its doors to everyone, and which is a very open country in general, we do not live in the 50s with Franco. I mean, this has evolved. There are people who He is still with Franco as if he were alive. And they are like in a kind of civil war between left and right of ideological pax. And it is ridiculous because even at that time, in the 30s, you read, for example, the clandestine publication to the phalanx. when they were illegalized and the reports came out about when they killed themselves. and they spoke with respect about the people... That is, you read the memoirs of some phalanxists or texts. and those of the communists who were in the shock brigades ,.that is to say, to kill themselves with those who literally killed each other.before the civil war, that is, during the Republic,.and they were people who later respected each other..And when they have written 20 or 30 years later about that moment, They literally killed each other for their ideas and yet they respected each other. You see now, it's like a chicken coop, they are there with each other, chattering, then they appear in photos laughing and drinking I don't know what. It's like there's an enmity and they create an enmity in the population. as if we were living in a civil war, but it does not exist... It is not that it is a war between the communists who are the social communists, Pedro Sánchez and Podemos, which makes me laugh, .and the fascists who are all the others...And there are neither fascists nor communists there, it's like a scam,...they are making people laugh and every time I say this to people their heads explode and Everything makes me sick, but it's the truth... And when I see photos of Espinosa de Alón Montero with Pablo Iglesias in parliament at the time, laughing and making jokes, I say, then why do you have that polarization when you speak? ?.If it is unreal, it is a lie, it is like facing the gallery..And people stop talking, they block each other, they run campaigns at a social level..And then the politicians who represent them, And you see how in the parliamentary sessions of the Republic, for example, and they were people who literally wanted to kill each other, but then you didn't see them together Tade, shock, we're going to party later. It didn't happen. Then they are laughing at people... And it is something that pisses me off greatly."

From the minute 00:31:20.110000 to 00:31:44.110000 Interviewer says: "Yes, I suppose it is like a play and that for them, the situation is much easier to deal with when the population is arguing and is distracted. between them, fighting continuously... And also linking a little with what you said before, what I feel is that today having something to offend you for has become a privilege... And if not "You have nothing that offends you, you need, I need a little flag to carry, something to defend, my message, my role on Twitter, I have to complain about something."

From the minute 00:31:55.110000 to 00:33:31.110000 Roberto Vaquero says: "and in the end they have to make like a stopover for the members and such, and it was so crazy and like everyone had to oppress each other that they dissolved ,.because it was who oppresses who more? It was like a game, like a role-playing game interpreting something...So it's not serious, it's not serious...I tell you, for example when they say, it's not that... ..When people say, no, there is a problem, for example, because people on the street speak in a different way, it is not correct..And you ask someone what are the problems in your neighborhood? And of course, immigration is going to tell you, I don't know what, it's going to tell you in a very direct way... And of course, and you say, no, but you are an oppressor, and he is a guy who has been working since from the morning until the afternoon, he goes to pick his daughter home, he has to accompany her so that nothing happens to her, he takes care of his family, he earns money to support her, that is, he is a person who is a good person, so to speak... Why is he an oppressor of anything? Why? Because he is white and lives in a neighborhood that is being robbed, he has an impossible life and is a hard worker, and a person who is a yuppie university student, who has never hit a brick in his life because He is living off his parents, and that person who is constructed and, oh, I'm very oppressed, that person is revolutionary, when in reality he is a parasite and you can call him those things. And that's how we see it. with the politicians that exist today, that is, there are politicians from your sea who come from being spokespersons for, who are going to talk about nothing if they are privileged people. Now we come to talk about the issue of the Sahara, for example. I know daughters of polisario leaders, that is, not exactly the most neglected people, who have come here with distinguished families because they are the children of, and now they are spokespersons who are dedicated to saying no, it is just that "I am an oppressed person and it's like, look, you have an apartment in Moncloa, you are a person who lives in luxury, you are a person with higher education and you have not had a problem in your entire life."

From the minute 00:33:10.370000 to 00:33:10.370000 Interviewer says: "Now we come to talk about that."

From the minute 00:33:38.370000 to 00:35:08.860000 Roberto Vaquero says: "There are people who can... For example, the Moroccan people in my neighborhood can say it, but you can't say it... And you live That's what you live off of. There are people who live off of being from that country, but you have to look at their material living conditions, because maybe their material living conditions are better than ours. I I don't own a house, I haven't had that opportunity yet... It's what you say, that if there isn't a flag, take another one, it doesn't matter... And a speech follows that everyone says the same thing, which is repulsive... I see it, for example, people will insult me ​​a lot later, with the issue of the spokesmen of the environmentalist thing... I defend the sustainability of the planet, I believe in ecology, but not in this environmentalism... I mean, this is ridiculous, it's making people laugh... That is, because a person uses plastic cups or not, it's not going to solve any problem... The problem is going to be that production stops and an alternative is provided. .And what they do is make people laugh..The Greta Thunbergs on duty are all as prefabricated..They dress the same, speak the same, make the same gestures..I see it the same with the female ones..I mean, to me I saw a talk they gave that was, you have to make an angry face, do like that... I mean, it's like a lobotomizing course, to make everyone the same... So it's a trend, it's a trend and it's see very clearly.. They don't care about sustainability, because sustainability is global.. If Spain stops producing one thing and it is produced, Coca-Cola here for example, stops producing one thing and three times as much is produced in China, the same company, there is no sustainability whatsoever. In other words, the problem is going to get worse. And that's how it is with all these ridiculous fashions."

From the minute 00:35:11.220000 to 00:35:51.930000 Interviewer says: "Yes, just like that... And what bothers me is when, apart from following the same pattern and the same clothing that I say, ....Please, don't make gestures...Yes, everything...But now, what bothers me the most is all the noise they try to make...I mean, you're vegan, okay...Why Do you put it in the biography of all your social networks? I hate that you are vegan... I mean, why? Why? But well, getting off that topic a little bit, something that I really liked about your speech .it's the defense of the flag, damn it, because for me this is pure common sense...practically the fact that you have a flag of Spain, which is your country..."

From the minute 00:35:56.490000 to 00:36:44.680000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I mean, absolutely everything, even the name... I mean, more country is called more country... What country is that? It gives them Shame... They put on an act, Rajon once put on an act and told a guy to boycott him. Long live Spain! And he said 'Long live!' But he spent half an hour justifying it, it was very unfortunate for me because he said 'Long live!' In a meeting, they have done it to me before, they say to me "Long live Spain!" And I say "Long live!" And I continue... Because I have no reason to be ashamed, it's just that I am from here... or with things, I don't know, I'm a historian... And also, the periods that I like the most are mine, which is contemporary, which is republic, etc., that period, and then I like the era of the Tercios...So I go to a lot of talks by the Tercios, I give lectures about that, I write about that too, and people call me a fascist...And it's like, fascism didn't exist at that time...I mean, in "At the time of the Tercios, fascism did not exist... It makes no sense."

From the minute 00:36:04.590000 to 00:36:04.590000 Interviewer says: "They are ashamed."

From the minute 00:36:49.910000 to 00:37:25.910000 Roberto Vaquero says: "everything is criminalized... In our actions we also use the republican flag, because it is a Spanish flag... But for example, when people come with the normal red one, well, they come... I mean, I want to tell you, I don't care, it's not an offense, because people feel Spanish, they grew up here, it's the flag they grew up with, and what? What are you going to do? Well, that's it, nothing happens. You accept it and that's it. And that's what everyone should do, because it makes no sense to attack your own country. It's how people play national team. , right? And you see a lot of Spaniards like, come on, France... And it's like, are you going with France? I mean, it's gotten to the point where it seems like a meme... I mean, "They hate their team, they hate their country, they hate their history, they hate their traditions, they hate their culture... And I think that comes a lot from the United States."

From the minute 00:37:28.970000 to 00:38:32.970000 Interviewer says: "Yes, I think they continue, in the end they follow the play we were talking about before, they follow it blindfolded, literally. .And they are so easy to fool..The other day I was here, I think you did something with him on your channel, Bertrand, from Vox, for example, and I was talking to him about something that I say, is that it is totally true to say, well for example, Íñigo de Rejón, you see it, the clothes they wear, you see it as the message of trying to sell grief, what you said about the gestures, it's a bit like everything has been studied... And I mean, every time I go out for a walk, every now and then I see you eating enarde, that there at the retreat, I don't know, they give 100, 200 bucks, I don't know, I've never eaten there, but I say, come on ..And after all you're missing is a hole here on your shirt, you know? And the clothes, everything, the non-verbal language... And in the end with that, I think it ends up being enough to deceive a large part of the population...So, I suppose that with your message when addressing the population, you appeal to what? to common sense, to situations."

From the minute 00:38:39.120000 to 00:41:56.490000 Roberto Vaquero says: "And I believe that it is something that unites many people... And yet, look, they criticize me a lot, for example, for the ways, right? I'm a guy who is very... Well, for example, feminist people would say about toxic masculinity, about a big guy, that if he has to say things, he says them, with strong gestures, serious...I mean, I'm a person who doesn't fit in a bit with how they do politics...People tell me, right? You should be a different way...And I say, I don't play a role. .People tell me, no, but a professional politician, I don't want to be a professional politician...I don't play a role, I do like that...And of course, they are like all of them copied...You see them and they are all as if cut off a bit of the same pattern, right? As a typical spokesperson, assimilated by the majority of people. And for me, we don't like that. And when I appeal, especially with the front, we We focus on several things... When you put them in they say, no, but what about your specific measure about I don't know what... And it's like, look, most politicians talk about measures that they are never going to apply, because They do not have the capacity to govern, nor will they have it, at least in the medium or long term..And what they do is like making fun of people to get votes..We are going to focus on five very clear things..One It is revolutionary patriotism.. Which is precisely calling for the country and merging it with the workers' struggle.. The second is to defend that struggle.. It cannot be that the unions go without going on strike and without doing anything when there are problems. and support labor reforms, which even the liberals agree with, so that they can see the class character that it has... That reform has to go to France, take photos because they are going to raise the retirement age. and we have to go on strikes..And then here in Spain they raise it and do nothing..There are subsidized unions, for me state-run, and that have absolutely no struggle at all..We want to rebuild a unionism that defends the interests of the workers.and that It's not like the union programs that talk about environmentalism, feminism, deconstruction, workshops of I don't know what, which is that we don't care. These are not problems that affect the workers. These unions increasingly They have fewer members. Another issue is the issue of immigration and the migratory model. We must change the migratory model immediately so as not to become France. And the other two are the fight against partitocracy, what we have said. from the left and the right, that we think that the regime itself has no possible salvation, the one here, because it changes the problems we have and something new is needed... A constituent process to do something new and that we are not living with the constitution.which our parents' generation or more approved..And then, finally, a bitter fight against guoquismo, against globalism, as you want to call it,.because we consider that they must be kicked out of spaces that they themselves are already starting to abandon. And that in countries like France or Germany, where the Communist Party won before, Le Pen or Alternative for Germany wins. And that is a symptom that they have abandoned any reference or any proposal for a resolution. the problems that affect workers...And we are going to focus on those five things...Everything else for us is secondary...That is what is important. We do not have a program on the internet, we have a summarized program as well, but that is what we are going to focus on. I am not saying, I am not talking about measures that yes, someday we will do. No, no, I am talking about what we are going to do now...Next week we are doing this now...I don't know if you have seen it...No...Well, we dropped a tarp and it came out denouncing what Moroccans are doing in Spain.and they come out kissing Mohamed Sesto and Pedro Sánchez... And of course, they have threatened us with death, they have called us to carry out attacks, they have denounced us, they have attacked the canvas... The threats."

From time 00:41:39.700000 to 00:41:39.700000 Interviewer says: "No."

From the minute 00:42:01.250000 to 00:42:41.250000 Roberto Vaquero says: "But individuals...No, no, in front...Yes, yes, individuals...I was showing at Tópiq in Algeria, of course, because the Algerians They have taken the opportunity to laugh.. And nothing, they try to attack us in places.. What happens is that we are not very impressionable because we already have the tough hosts. From the time of Syria and all that, that the Turks also in that sense They are giving more taking, because it doesn't matter to us a little bit. But it is simply to set an example so that people can see that it is not the same. In other words, right now I can go out here and they can do to me I don't know what. , but I don't care... I mean, we are people, we are tough people and we promote people to be like that... And in the face of difficulty, what you have to do is grow, not become small and say that you have anxiety... When you have it, I think you have to crack your fists, get out of the problem, and then later the rest will be solved... Of course."

From the minute 00:42:47.920000 to 00:42:47.920000 Interviewer says: "So, do you think that difficult times are coming and that it will be difficult for them to navigate those seas?"

From the minute 00:42:55.870000 to 00:47:39.870000 Roberto Vaquero says: "And I think it will be very related to what is happening in France...And I think that the people here, in Spain, are not prepared right now at no level. to face what is going to happen.. In fact, in places it is a different problem, for example, that of gangs.. But in El Salvador, Bukele, for example, has shown that if War is actually declared on certain issues. It can be solved. But it has been a country at war, that is, to be able to achieve it. And times like this are coming, very complicated times are coming. And there are going to be two options..One, dissolve and be something new..Or another, grab the bull by the fists and fight for what we are..And we are preparing for that option, because I believe that is what is going to happen.. In fact, in France I think it will happen sooner than here... And I think... Of course, people say, no, but that's the end... I think not, because I believe... I have tried to look for the origin of the phrase, but I can't find it, the one about...many people say it, right? That difficult times make tough men...Yes, the cycle...Yes, yes, and I believe that it will be like that... That is, I believe that we are going to a very complicated situation... That this situation comes in all things due to the weakness that has been fostered... Because I believe that in other times this would not be possible. would have been allowed..I mean, there are certain things that I think would not have been allowed..People would have gone out into the streets and it would not have been allowed..And I think that from there people will come out who will be hardened by what is going to happen. ..And let him face this..And we are working to create people like that..When kids approach us, for example, we have a very great youthful grip, it is the strongest thing we have..That is a symptom of the future...When people come, we encourage people to train, to study...That people finish...Of course, because many people sometimes come from certain neighborhoods or from problems...that people do not want to study nor do they want to do nothing..And we tell people that they have to be productive..And that they have to get trained..Because a person, if they have abilities, can contribute a lot to the collective..If a person does not know how to do anything, they do not can contribute anything..You can be a lot of people, but in reality it is worth nothing..So you first have to build yourself and then contribute to others..Because otherwise you are like something parasitic on the group..And I think which is an erroneous way of seeing the community, especially organizations...What you have to do is train people...That people give you critical capacity, that people are intelligent, that people are trained... Because what most organizations do is have lobotomized people, who know a lot about the manuals that repeat things, but they are not critical.. Because they do not want anyone to be critical of what they do.. But we are the other way around. And people can go wrong, obviously... But for every one that goes well like this, 20 people could go wrong, if they want... I wouldn't care, it would be a success, which is not the case... But it would be a success. Because we want to train people with capacity... And I, there are many kids who have entered into our things... They have already entered because they came from being odogified, from being alcoholics... Very young people, eh? And they have ended up Over the years, taking degrees, taking modules, training, competing in boxing things, things like that, in weightlifting... We encourage people to develop... And for people to have the capabilities to be able to contribute to things. collective..Because if not, we would be like many organizations that have very weak, very fragile people, who are not prepared for any complication..You keep in mind, I am going to Barcelona, ​​for example..And a mob of people shouting at me, trying to hit us... We're going to Seville or wherever. People come with helmets, with sticks to hit... That happens. There is one of our stalls and they come to bust our stall... That happens to us constantly... So, what's happening? That we need people who can face that... It is no longer just about facing it physically, but facing it psychologically, that it is a pressure... So we go with our own order service. We have super prepared people. Why? Because we have forged ourselves in the difficulty that before things happened to us, and now we do not allow them to happen. And I think it is a very appropriate mentality when creating an organizational structure that can be used for something in the future. And I think it's a question of values...And that above all...People tell me, no, you're very medieval, but there are things like having honor, having a word...These are things that say, no, But that has nothing to do. Well, I think so... Because a person without words, what differentiates us from an animal? I'm really telling you... I mean, I try to encourage people like that.... Companionship, that is, certain things that are very devalued in society and that I believe don't have to be like that. For example, in many leftist groups, not being competitive is encouraged, right? You are not competitive, that is, competitive in the sense that it affects you to become a monster for yourself, no, but... ..Being hungry..In the sense, yes, of wanting to improve yourself, of wanting to have goals..If you don't have that, you are not going to move forward..There are people who tell me, no, because it is that You have a very entrepreneurial mentality... And it's true... But because a person, regardless of society, of conditions, has to try to make themselves... Because if not, in reality, you will never be well. ...Because you are not going towards what you want...And that is for politics and for everything."

From the minute 00:43:48.390000 to 00:48:23.160000 Interviewer says: "Many people say that, right? It's super paradoxical to talk to you, really. I know this hits us hard, but it's what I think really..And I had not heard this part of your message specifically, but I really congratulate you because it seems to me...I mean, it seems to me that it is something so simple, so basic, but at the same time so important and so fundamental for a person, the fact of being useful, of having your own criteria, of being a little critical, of taking care of what you put in your body, what you do with it, how you develop it... These are the bases, really. ..I see many people looking for the magic formula and I say, hey, it's the four pillars, what you said, the preparation you try to give to young people, do I understand? I'm going to call you bad. "

From the minute 00:48:24.590000 to 00:50:18.590000 Roberto Vaquero says: "When I talk about militant culture, at the level of culture of how any person should be from my point of view, I talk about denial, of sacrifice, of discipline, of study, of training... In other words, they are things that strengthen you... I give you the example of what happened in prison... I, for example, came out a new man. Why ? Because I trained every day, three hours... And the rest I dedicated myself to reading and doing things, and thinking and reflecting... to put together, reflect, that is, put everything aside, which only now, too, do I leave my cell phone, leave things and I start to think... I start to think about what I'm going to do, what I want, I start to think... People don't do that, they don't stop to think... They're like with TikTok, almost everything the day, a video, video, video, video... And you turn off and say, what's the first video you've seen? He doesn't even know... He's just using and he's totally addicted... It's okay to use the networks, it's It's okay to use technologies, it's okay to use everything, but let it be an instrument for you to grow, right? Not something that destroys you, that you have an unhealthy dependency... And that happens with alcohol. I don't drink alcohol, for example... And there are people who think it's okay that if they want to drink they can do whatever they want, but I, for example, don't... But I'm against people being addicted, of that people are alcoholics, that people have a dependency and that their lives are destroyed... At the level of youth, especially since the current outlook is so similar, we encourage people not to do those things... And the People tell us, no, it's just that I'm a fascist and I... It's not true. It's just that the things I'm talking about are about honor, about personal matters, right? Because, of course, people say, no, It is that you have become with the order and that, but the thing is that a person who does not have order in his life and who functions in an anarchic and destructive way, is not going to be able to contribute to anyone. Because if you are destroyed by Inside, how are you going to contribute to anyone? Not to your family, not to your friend, not to your girlfriend, not to your children, not to anything, you cannot contribute... You have to make people healthy... I believe that What society promotes right now is not that, it is quite the opposite... And this is not about ideologies. I mean, for me, this is about having half a brain... I mean, people can later criticize me for my ideology, for whatever they want... But what I'm saying, you may like it or not. , but it is something that many people who do not have my ideology tell me, well I like what you say. "It has nothing to do with ideology... It's like a way of understanding personal development."

From the minute 00:50:23.330000 to 00:50:28.330000 Interviewer says: "Well, look, I consider myself an entrepreneur by nature and the truth is that the message is very linked... I would like to know at what point you break with the figure of an entrepreneur, for example, or businessman."

From the minute 00:50:38.890000 to 00:51:06.890000 Roberto Vaquero says: "in the order of ideal society that would be for me, that is, I believe that there it does break...Because I, for example, am very entrepreneurial, but me, the entrepreneur that I am, apart from my personal development of survival, etc., is also to contribute to the collective... And I believe that people who are very entrepreneurial and very good at entrepreneurship focus more on themselves. themselves...And to make money and to rise. And that is their objective...And I think I have a different objective and as more of a society...And I think that is where we differ."

From the minute 00:51:10.440000 to 00:51:14.440000 Interviewer says: "In other words, you prioritize, let's say, the community before the individual... I think that's the point."

From the minute 00:51:18.970000 to 00:52:41.150000 Interviewer says: "Of course...Hey, and a question...I mean, from your situation, let's say that you are a person who prioritizes the collective in a society or in an environment where each person prioritizes their individual situation, their family, etc. Also, therefore, you begin to prioritize your individual situation. I mean, I suppose that if you can buy, what do I know, if you had the option of saving and buying properties to have them. for heritage, for your children, you do it, right?"

From the minute 00:51:19.080000 to 00:52:09.080000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Of course...But I think that for the collective you also have to be an entrepreneur in the sense of building...There are many people who like to achieve A job, for example, stays there and that's it... And I think it's a mentality that they also get into that, damn, you also have to know how to move and know how to progress in order to... I, for example, want have children. I have a girlfriend and I want to have children... I have to build something there to be able to have it... I can't dedicate myself to having a dependency and waiting to see if I get lucky and it goes well... No, no, I have a personal goal, I will have to achieve it... Then I also ask other questions that we do differ on that... But in the construction of my family, for example, I will also have to look for the good of my family... But the thing is that My family is not something individual... There are also many people who think, no, it's just that it's individual... If it's a family, it's not individual... It's a small community, but it's not individual... And There are people who also call me reactionary for this,"

From the minute 00:52:44.970000 to 00:54:48.530000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I could have prospered much more economically. If I focused on myself than if I focused on what I am doing... But me, for example, well no Obviously, for my own ideological reasons, I will not dedicate myself to speculating or doing any of those things, but I am a person who writes, I sell my books, I produce things... I am a guy who does what does have value..Of course..There are many people who criticize me, no, it's just that you're like I don't know what..No, it's that the problem is that you don't produce any value when you do things.or you don't do anything and I I am a person who what I do generates value... I am a person whose head explodes, but that is what I am telling you, people must be trained. If people had... I believe that injustice It is there that it is not encouraged, that people are trained and that there are people in certain environments who do not have the opportunity or have it too difficult. And I believe that what needs to be done is to encourage people to have capabilities. ,.but the thing is that teaching right now, and I'm telling you, I'm in a doctoral program,...is that it doesn't encourage that, it doesn't encourage that...In fact, most people, for example, in my career He wants to be a teacher. And he wants to be a civil servant. The way he is focused right now is that it is not very productive. Because we have a state that is ultra bureaucratized. What is there? I don't know, when I see things about the administration, it works. in a terrible way, and I think that it can be optimized even with fewer people. and promote work in another way, even from the state. And I think that what is done is create dependencies because like this, like clientelist networks, and it depends whoever it is, I believe that they get votes, they get influence and they get certain things... Because of course, the PAC thing too, that is, I in my ideal society, obviously not even in the ideal law, I, For example, I would socialize the statistical sectors, that is, I would nationalize them so that people understand me, there are things that I would make radical changes, but the issue of... No, it is that more state and more bureaucracy It is better... Well, it depends on who dominates the state, it depends on what for, it depends on whether it is effective... It is just that to think that everything that has to do with state intervention has to be something, that it has losses, that it is super bureaucratic, that it is like a herial, I think it is a mistake... That is, although there have been historical examples that have gone wrong, I think that this mentality is already like a failure, it is already admitted that this is not It works and I think that's a mistake too."

From the minute 00:54:56.260000 to 00:55:03.260000 Interviewer says: "I mean, I can still see your final, ideal photo, but the transition, how do you imagine it? Because, I mean, today It is a reality that the only profitable company is the Lottery, right? One of the public ones, then..."

From the minute 00:55:09.840000 to 00:58:22.050000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I believe that now what matters is the recovery of national sovereignty... Because any measure we want to take, for example, with immigration, the borders, etc., without national sovereignty we cannot change it, nor develop the industry, nor re-technize the field and make it start to work.. I mean, I think that is the main thing.. And people say , anyone would say that measure, not a commotion... Well, okay, congratulations, but I think it is what is needed... And I think that then there is a deficit, when it comes to... Even from a point of view of democratism, of democracy, I think there is a deficit, the way things are, that people do not really participate in things, and then, in addition, important things are not voted on. People are always talking about referendums, .but a referendum has not been held on the immigration model, a referendum has not been held to destroy our industry, a referendum has not been held to leave land without production in Andalusia.and we buy it from Morocco or the relations with Morocco..That has not been voted on anywhere..So, I believe that that is why there has to be a constituent change.for there to be a new constitution that really solves certain problems..For example, the issue of the independentists. Here in Spain the electoral laws favor this being the case...I understand when they did it. That is, when they did it and the Communist Party was annulled. Why? Because it could be a danger in the year 75, 76, well, in 75 later... Okay, but that is no longer a danger... Now, people who get fewer votes than PACMA. are deciding or may even have the key to the government..That cannot be. It can't be... It's something that no longer provides a solution to the problems that exist... That's why I often criticize Vox and Podemos that yes, they are coming to change I don't know what, but they are in all governments autonomous communities that can...Well, now it's going to be their sea...And then they don't...I don't see them saying, no, we have to remove the constitution.and we have to have a process in which everyone participates. the world of something new..I don't see them doing that..On the contrary, Podemos released a document that was like their program with the Constitution..Okay, Vox with the issue of the monarchy and all this the same..In fact, with The campaign against Mohamed VI, as it is monarchy with monarchy, we have overtaken them on all sides. And I think that in that sense you can see it, right? You can see that, although the two want to make small changes,. the two, that is, the two parties, even if they are in opposite directions, I see that deep down it is like the crutch parties of the greats... And I speak this a lot... I am going to say one thing that at the same time people go crazy, but I, for example, talk to people who are deputies of Podemos or who have been deputies, because I know them from when I was a kid and we were all in the communist youth. ..So yes, there are a lot of people who hate me, whatever you want, but to a guy that you have known for 25 or 20 years, because you keep talking to him and there they talk to me and tell me things. and I have... and with people from Vox too, and I tell them... And the answer is already, but that way at least we do something... I mean, I would like what you say about the PACs. No, I would like... I know people in Vox who are very anti-bullfighting... I know people in Vox who, with the issue of immigration, think that the measures that we say are much more precise. and that we touch the issue in a more general way too... They are never going to say it publicly... to me there are people who are now at sea,... but people who have been deputies here, from Madrid, from the community... And to me There are things we do, for example, about the workers' struggle, the unions and the things we do that they tell me, damn, they are very right about this... But they will never say it, why? Because they take away from them... Because they take away from them."

From the minute 00:58:19.830000 to 00:58:23.220000 Interviewer says: "But they will never say it, because they take it away from them... And now that you mentioned it, at the immigration level, what is the proposal?"

From the minute 00:58:28.370000 to 00:59:04.370000 Roberto Vaquero says: "In fact I have a book... A summary... If you're not going to see it, I'll bring it to you... But hey, one day I pass by I'll bring it to the court if you want... I, first of all, there is a question of conception... That is, the problem is not immigration itself nor the immigrant itself... That I believe it is a mistake to criminalize the person .and it is a mistake to think that immigration can be eradicated by magic. There has been immigration before, there has been immigration now, there will be immigration in the future. The issue is massiveness. That is the problem we have here. ..And people say, no, but what about when it is decided when there are more people that the country can receive? Well, I believe that there are some very clear symptoms. The first is that the unemployment is no longer just national, "But the immigrant population has significant unemployment."

From the minute 00:58:29.810000 to 00:58:30.810000 Interviewer says: "A summary...If you're not going to see it, I'll bring it to you."

From the minute 00:59:10.920000 to 01:01:34.190000 Roberto Vaquero says: "I think it also shows that there are very precarious jobs, that there are people who are not willing to take them. Why? Because they are conditions that only someone who has absolutely nothing will accept... Recently there was a case in which some job offers came out in Andalusia that said they had no manpower... And one of the guys who wrote to me told me Hey, I asked how much money you make with this. And I have to move out of the city because I live in a house. He says, it costs me more to go there than what they pay me. Why? Because it is a job offer that is designed based on the shanty town next door to the site. and people who have nothing.. Then the jobs are impoverished.. Being a waiter when I was a child was a job.. There was people who were 60 years old, and retired as a waiter and it was a good job... Nowadays who works as a waiter? When I walk around the places, they are mostly young immigrant people... Why? Because they are the ones who are going to accept that now... As soon as they progress, those people are going to take other types of jobs... What's happening? That they need more new people...So they bring them. There are people who are improving, obviously, because they make an effort, because there are people who make an effort, there are people who don't... But it is a continuum, it is a continuum... So it cannot be that last year in the migratory saint they came more than half a million people..Why? Because if you do this in 10, 15, 20 years, what do we have left in the end? There is no longer Spain, it is something else. Then a country has the capacity to assimilate people. And in Spain It is overflowing.. That is, at the same time that there is unemployment among the immigrant population. and they begin to gather in ghettos separated from society,. but in Germany and other places they even impose laws. such as Islamic law, even with police. Islamic, which is like a co-official, in the sense that it is allowed for internal affairs. That is a dystopia. That happens in France and Germany. So that is a problem. That is a very serious problem. Why? Because starting an alternative reaction for Germany is about to be the leading force in the polls. Why? Because people are fed up with this... And the left says, nothing is happening... The issue of the south, the southern border in reality, I mean there are many people who do a lot of demagoguery, there are parties that do a lot of demagoguery with this But the problem is not in the number of people who sneak through the strait, because there are tens of thousands compared to the half million that I just told you that arrived last year. The number is much fewer people. . Even in illegal immigration, massive numbers of people come by plane. They come by plane, they come here, and then they are regularized over time. That should also be controlled. The problem in the south is security, you don't know who is coming. Because there are people "It's not that he's running away, that he's a political refugee, but that he's maybe a rapist, and he comes here, he tears up the papers, he gets here, I'm nobody, and then he does his thing here."

From the minute 01:00:47.610000 to 01:00:47.610000 Interviewer says: "That happens in France and Germany."

From the minute 01:01:37.870000 to 01:05:41.200000 Roberto Vaquero says: "People, we don't know who is coming, because there is no control... And that is a problem. The people who come by plane do know who they are. But the people who come on that boat, there will be people who come to work and that is very good, but I don't think it's good that they come like that. I think they should be deported, because everyone can come here. then the country has no meaning... A country that does not control its borders is dissolved... I believe that the border must be controlled, that this can be done with police and staff, and we must put an end to the call effect ...How is that done? Like in Australia. What Australia did was set up a port, which is where they take the army, when people come with the mafias, they take the army out to sea, they have control, .like a blockade..In other words, whenever the boat or boat arrives, they catch it, they take the immigrants down, they take them to the safe port, from there they send them directly to their country, that is, the success rate now of arriving There it is zero, they put the gangsters in jail and they sink their boats. What's happening? That in the first years there were many interventions, but a mafia is a company. It's like a company, they don't get tired, they don't make money. So, if they don't make money, then they start doing something else. .There are no deaths in the sea, and in the Mediterranean they do not stop dying..What is human?.End the mafia and put an end to that,.or the discourse of the NGOs is of.no, it is that everything The world has a place here. And they continue to die at sea. I believe that in Australia, and that is what I propose here. Well, there are a lot more people today, not just me, but this is one thing: as soon as you say it, you're a Nazi. So you have to be careful, it doesn't matter to me anymore, I'm cured. of horror..I say what I think, and if you like it, and if you don't, then let them lynch me, it doesn't matter to me..As for the visas, we have to stop giving out so many visas, it can't be that they come .in that balance.more than half a million a year, it is not normal..And then what we have to do is encourage jobs.to have decent conditions.and make sure that the youth who are unemployed.and the three million of unemployed people that we have, well start putting them in. Obviously I'm going to tell you one thing, if we have been with suicidal immigration policies since 97, 20 or so years, this started with ANAR, that's why I say about the left and the right is of no use here. And with the birth rate, exactly the same, what is happening? Obviously when we take measures to solve it there will be a withdrawal at the population level and at all levels, That is to say, that is going to happen... But of course, to solve it, it has to be like that, they also told Bukele, no, but if this happens, the violence will increase. And it did increase, but then it's over... So, what matters to me is solving the problem. All this left says, no, we have to decrease, they say it, we have to decrease at all levels. Well, if you like degrowth so much, why can't we decrease for a few years while we make measures regarding birth rates, different immigration policies, and integration of what is already here? Because there are people here who will obviously have to leave, and then there will be people who will have to be encouraged to be able to integrate for normal functioning... which I propose, putting an end to that massiveness. to grow in an orderly way. and then later When those plans are working, they will grow again. I mean, I am not referring to Malthusianism, but it is an objective question of if you have had a suicidal policy for almost 30 years, fixing it is complicated. It's not a magical thing. That is to say, if Bukele comes to power tomorrow and puts an end to illegal immigration, I don't know that they will succeed. They arrive, they win the elections here. In a few years, they put an end to illegal immigration. And half a million people a year continue to come. There will be more feedback. So these are things that have to be taken into account. Bear in mind that there will have to be take dodastic measures..And I tell you that.the most important thing for me.is to avoid the ghettos that already exist..How? Breaking up those ghettos... And if the police have to come in and people have to be separated, like the Nordic countries, it seems like everyone can take action except us... And what they do is, for example, .30% of immigrant population maximum.in a city, for example. If there are more people, they go to the next city. They can't all be together. Because? Because if there is not something homogeneous to integrate or assimilate, what they do is feed back and they will never integrate. In areas where, for example, in France, there are 70% people of origin. immigrant who has not integrated over the years, how are they going to integrate into the 30% that remains, who probably also have a very high average age... It is impossible."

From the minute 01:05:42.920000 until 01:05:44.920000 Interviewer says: "to congregate too... Of course. In all places"

From the minute 01:05:47.920000 to 01:07:23.500000 Roberto Vaquero says: "something must be done now with the issue of massiveness. But immigration is not illegal, it is the model... Because Legal immigration of half a million a year is a problem. And the issue of nationalities, of giving nationality to people who, for example, do not even speak Spanish, that is a problem. In fact, since 2010 there has been more than one and a half million nationalities. That is outrageous for a country. It is outrageous. So, we have to take... My objective with the book is to put the immigration issue at the center of the debate. and that there be a debate about it... That is the objective. That is, more than about measures that I also speak of, I speak of analysis of the phenomenon as it is now and why we have arrived here and the policies that are made now. ..And it is a serious problem. Look how serious it is. That the UN or other countries. to calculate, for example, how many immigrants there are in a country, they calculate it based on the people who were not born in the country. country...it's not done like that. That is to say, all the people who have nationality are not counted as being of immigrant origin. We say that if it's not racist, that's it, but it's unreal. In Spain there is no less than 12% immigration. In Spain we are already on the 16th. Only with those born outside. Because, of course, the people who are born here and raised in a ghetto and don't relate to anything, those people who were born here are Spanish. If you don't have Spanish culture, you are not Spanish. That's it, we have to start from that base. I don't care about the color of your skin, it doesn't matter exactly the same to me... But it's a cultural issue, it's an ethnic issue. The thing is, if you grew up apart and don't have our culture, you don't function the way our society works, you're not really from here. I'm not saying that I can't live here, but why give nationality to people who are not from here? In other words, it's like despising being Spanish, like everyone can be Spanish. And that's a"

From the minute 01:07:26.500000 to 01:07:40.500000 Interviewer says: "The imbalance also at the economic, fiscal, health, at many levels is tremendous. Then, within your party, the economic. proposal "How do they set it up, how do they pose it?"

From the minute 01:07:43.500000 to 01:10:17.500000 Roberto Vaquero says: "as I told you, we are leaving because we have no intention of governing or entering any government. In other words, if we get a representative we will go. to war there. We.have the approach that we have told you, because that is what we are going to do. I mean, I really believe that there are priorities and in the economic aspect and you can say.my vision that I believe that I would do a purge of what everything state is like because I think it is very ineffective. Not in the sense that the State must be eliminated, of course, I don't think that, but I do think it should work. in another way. Even.at the level of the self-employed, for example, the issue.of quotas, of paying.for working, of the current sections, that some are very.unfair and that make people. It's really bad. That is, we would ask many questions to optimize what there is. That would be the first. The second would be to end the issue of sovereignty with economic dependencies with other countries, which is another. serious problem that we have, especially with the European Union, yes, money arrives, although less and less arrives and in the end we will have to pay much more than what we receive. But I don't think that's it either. for a... That does not work, it is no longer an optimal development. Obviously at the labor level, we are always going to promote measures, whatever they are, and carry out a labor reform, which is in favor of the workers, not like what there is now and not doing what Yolanda.de does, it is I am less and less unemployed than ever and there are permanent, discontinuous ones, which is how I send you half a year of unemployment and it is a gigantic number of people. I mean, in that sense I'm clear, but we don't have a... How to put it, if we have the economic plan, it is posted on the Internet, in the political program, which is not electoral, but we think that Right now that specifically is not something that we can change or develop. So when we have the Congress in the middle of next year, before the Europeans, we will do a deeper development in that. sense, but.keep in mind that we are like a party in.movements, we have started with Legal Imperative.in construction. We...before we were like Pro Committee, Pro Frente Obrero, because we were.to create it and we in Congress had it.a year or so ago. I mean, actually, we are very new. We've been there for two years in total, two and a half years, three, but we're really starting to get going. So it is evident that we are not going to have, what I said before the measures, concrete measures for everything... But come on, what I can say is that people say, no, they are going to implement communism. tomorrow. No, that is real because even in the Workers' Front the majority of the people are not... But the overwhelming majority of the people are not communists or anything... In other words, they are people who care. for your country, which obviously has a pro-worker perspective."

From time 01:10:19.370000 to 01:10:21.370000 Interviewer says: "That's a little more personal perspective of yours. The topic of communism. Oh, okay, I didn't know."

From the minute 01:10:21.840000 until 01:11:11.840000 Roberto Vaquero says: "Ah, okay, I didn't know...But not the Front. What the Front is betting on is... well, well, for a... how to put it, a.launch, a national reconstruction.and precisely.with popular sovereignty to take.the measures we need at all levels.economic, political,.dependency, immigration,.absolutely everything. But that's just what we are. an organization under construction and we do not deceive people. That is, when we say we are going to focus on this, that is what we are going to do. And we have already said the rest of the things. We are going to put it in a secondary place... But as I said, one of the points is the fight for the defense of interests. Because many people say about rights, I think that is insufficient for interests. of the workers. Which I believe that these people do not do, because for them the oppressed subjects are others, not the workers."

From the minute 01:11:16.460000 to 01:11:18.460000 Interviewer says: "by all means if you don't have clear pillars, let's defend this."

From the minute 01:11:19.390000 to 01:11:23.390000 Roberto Vaquero says: "What I'm saying, you see us anywhere or whatever and you're going to say, it's the same thing... Well, I don't deceive anyone "

From the minute 01:11:26.350000 to 01:11:50.350000 Interviewer says: "And then I was left wanting a little bit to see more of what you are like on a personal level, whether it was the best of the match, of .the topic of companies and so on..Okay, because you said something that caught my attention, that for example you sell books.and you say of course, but this is the result of.my work. So where does the friction create for you? "I really understand what it is when an individual becomes very rich without working."

From the minute 01:11:53.350000 to 01:12:37.350000 Roberto Vaquero says: "it would be foreign to me. But well, for me, the Frente Obrero, for example, also aspires to win over the self-employed and defend their interests, even the small neighborhood businessman, etc., we are also going to defend their interests against the oligarchy and against the big companies. So of course, it is not the same... I know that this shocks people But they elected me as president, because I'm a guy with drive, I'm a guy with charisma, so I'm very useful for this. But I say again that what the Front defends is what comes out. the program..I can defend.on a personal level. You won't know me in places defending things other than the Front. I don't know that they ask me for my personal opinion, but.not us.... The Workers' Front does not now aspire to..."

From the minute 01:12:40.640000 to 01:13:36.640000 Roberto Vaquero says: "There are people there who do, who consider that the program that for us is minimum is good for the country and for the workers. but we are in that dynamic..And we are working on the construction of the Front now..We consider that the other thing is like.playing with imaginary things..It is unreal..It is unreal,.I am going to say something a little controversial now, but what the communist movement is is dead at a global level. What there is now is low-woke or parties that are in absolute decomposition. It is something that is quite dead. Just as I consider that what the fascist movements were, etc. I think they are quite dead too... So, moving through dichotomies of... no, this really is, that they always try to do that... I have gotten rid of moving. by labels, etc. I prefer to do things that I really consider to be in the way of what I see as an optimal society. And that's what I'm working on, in the Front and that's why I'm in the Front, otherwise I wouldn't be there, I'd be somewhere else."

From the minute 01:12:40.940000 to 01:12:40.940000 Interviewer says: "No, no, he's not a communist."

From time 01:13:38.420000 to 01:14:16.420000 Interviewer says: "I see that you have a very down-to-earth approach right now. Because I saw a fragment, for example, of the debate you had on the podcast. by Jordi Wild.with Juan Ramón Rayo..And of course, on both sides I saw situations as very idealistic to say, both on the part of Juan Ramón, something.extremely liberal that,at least I can't imagine. that could.happen in the.short or medium term..And also the communist.system that you propose as ideal.I also think that, as you were saying, you are something.very difficult to..."

From the minute 01:14:16.720000 until 01:17:07.130000 Roberto Vaquero says: "of....The material conditions are important...There are many people who talk about no, the Revolution,...and the Revolution is of what? In your imaginary house... It's unreal. And with the hell that they asked us both to have that debate... It's a question that's more ideological and more intellectual in the sense of what our ideal model of life would be. issues..But I tell you, I am focused on what I have said..With the Front I am not calling for the Socialist Revolution because it is stupid..It is like calling something.in the current phase, with the current conditions.imaginary. That is why I dedicate myself to building.something that for me is minimal,.but that I consider that if we achieved it it would be.something very revolutionary..And so I am focused on that..And the people to Sometimes he points at me and tells me: no, you're a traitor... Yes, but you're talking about non-binary bathrooms. That's not the Revolution either. And that's... that's what those people do.
