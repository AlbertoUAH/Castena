### Metrics

To evaluate LLM performance, [QAEvalChain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/evaluation/langchain.evaluation.qa.eval_chain.QAEvalChain.html), [cosine_similarity](https://www.engati.com/glossary/cosine-similarity#:~:text=In%20NLP%2C%20Cosine%20similarity%20is,in%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20space.) and a [sentence similarity model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) are used

#### Results

| Video Name            | Channel     | Topic  | QAEvalChain (% Corrected Answer) | Mean Cosine Similarity | Median Cosine Similarity | Mean Sentence Similarity | Median Sentence Similarity |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Worldcast #45 - Roberto Vaquero | Worldcast   | Politics & Opinion| 20 out of 30 corrected answers (~67 %) | 0.7943 | 0.8198 | 0.7225 | 0.7406 |
